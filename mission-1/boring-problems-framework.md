# The Boring Problems Framework

This is how you identify B2B software opportunities worth $20K+.

## The 4 Criteria (All Must Be Met)

### 1. Manual Process Hell

**What it is:**
They're doing this task manually using:
- Paper forms
- Spreadsheets
- Manual data entry
- Copy/paste between systems
- Hours of repetitive work

**Good signs:**
- "We spend X hours on this every week"
- "It's all manual"
- "We use spreadsheets"
- "Someone has to sit and enter all this data"

**Example:**
Fire inspection companies spending 4 hours after each inspection filling out AES forms manually.

---

### 2. High-Frequency Repetition

**What it is:**
They do this task frequently:
- **Minimum:** 10 times per month
- **Ideal:** 50+ times per week
- **Jackpot:** Multiple times per day

**Good signs:**
- "Every inspection"
- "Every service call"
- "Every client"
- "We do 100+ of these per week"

**Example:**
HVAC company doing 100+ service visits per week, each requiring compliance documentation.

---

### 3. Compliance or Revenue-Critical

**What it is:**
The task is either:
- **Compliance-critical:** Government required, regulatory necessity, legal obligation
- **Revenue-critical:** Directly affects ability to bill clients or collect payment

**Good signs:**
- "We can't bill without this"
- "Required by the state"
- "We'll get fined if we don't"
- "Can't invoice until this is complete"

**Example:**
Property management companies must file compliance reports for 500+ units or face fines.

---

### 4. Terrible Existing Software

**What it is:**
Current software options are:
- **Non-existent** (they built spreadsheets)
- **Too expensive** ($500+/user/month)
- **Too generic** (doesn't fit their workflow)
- **Outdated** (built in 2008, crashes, slow)
- **Too complex** (takes months to learn)

**Good signs:**
- "We tried [Software] but it didn't work"
- "Too expensive for us"
- "Doesn't do what we need"
- "We just use spreadsheets"

**Example:**
Fire inspection software exists, but doesn't support California AES forms, costs $400/user/month, or was built in 2008.

## Value Calculation

Use this formula to determine if a problem is worth $20K+:

**Time Saved × Frequency × Hourly Cost = Monthly Value**

### Example Calculation:

**Current situation:**
- Task takes: 4 hours
- Frequency: 20 times per month
- Hourly cost: $50 (employee or owner time)

**Calculation:**
- Monthly value: 4 × 20 × $50 = $4,000/month
- Annual value: $4,000 × 12 = $48,000/year

**Pricing:**
- Charge 20-30% of annual value
- In this case: $10K-$15K upfront + $1,000-$1,500/month

**ROI for client:**
- They save: $48,000/year
- They pay: $33,000 in Year 1 ($15K + $1,500/month × 12)
- Net benefit: $15,000 in Year 1
- **Clear win for them**

## When All 4 Criteria Are Met

**This is gold.**

If a problem:
- ✅ Is done manually (criterion 1)
- ✅ Happens frequently (criterion 2)
- ✅ Is critical to their business (criterion 3)
- ✅ Has terrible/no software (criterion 4)
- ✅ Has annual value of $20K+ (calculation)

**You've found a problem worth solving.**

## Common Mistakes

### False Positives:

**"This would be nice to have"**
- Not painful enough. They won't pay.
- Must be: "We're bleeding time/money on this"

**"Sometimes we do this"**
- Not high-frequency enough
- Must be: "We do this constantly"

**"We've been living with it"**
- Not painful enough to pay for solution
- Must be: "This is killing us"

**"Our boss won't pay for software"**
- No budget, no sale
- Must be: "We'd pay to fix this"

### Red Flags:

- Problem seems big but isn't costing them money
- They "want" a solution but won't actually pay
- Frequency is lower than they claim
- Existing software is "good enough" even if they complain
- Too niche (only 10 potential clients exist)

## Using This Framework

When you find a potential problem:

1. **Ask:** Does it meet all 4 criteria?
2. **Calculate:** What's the annual value?
3. **Evaluate:** Is it worth $20K+?
4. **Validate:** Use the problem-identifier skill

**If yes to all:** You've found gold.

**If no to any:** Keep looking. Don't waste time on weak problems.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the framework:

1. Pick your target industries
2. Start researching businesses
3. Use The Compass skills to accelerate
4. Find problems that meet all 4 criteria
5. Calculate their value
6. Document your findings

The framework is your filter. Use it ruthlessly.

Only pursue problems that meet ALL 4 criteria.

Quality over quantity. One great problem beats three mediocre ones.

Let's find gold. 🧭
