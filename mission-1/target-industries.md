## Why These Industries Work

### Common Characteristics:

**1. High-Frequency Operations**
- They do the same tasks 10+ times per month (minimum)
- Often 50-100+ times per week
- More frequency = more value = easier to justify price

**2. Compliance-Heavy**
- Government regulations require documentation
- They MUST do this or they can't operate
- Compliance = non-negotiable = they'll pay

**3. Terrible/Nonexistent Software**
- Generic software doesn't fit their specific workflow
- Existing tools are outdated (2008-era) or too expensive
- They're using spreadsheets and paper

**4. Fragmented Markets**
- Thousands of small businesses (5-50 employees)
- Not dominated by giant corporations
- Small businesses need custom solutions but can't afford enterprise software

**Bad reasons NOT to pick an industry:**
