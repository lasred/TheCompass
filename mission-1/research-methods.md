# Research Methods (Without Talking to Anyone Yet)

Mission 1 is pure online research. No calls. No outreach.

Here's how to find valuable problems without talking to businesses yet.

## Method 1: Company Websites

**What to look for:**
- Services they offer (what do they do?)
- Team size (how many employees?)
- Service areas (where do they operate?)
- Technology they mention (what tools are they using?)

**Where to find insights:**
- "About Us" - understand their operations
- Services page - what tasks they do repeatedly
- Careers page - what roles they're hiring (hints at bottlenecks)
- Contact page - how they handle communication

**Example:**
Fire inspection company website says "we serve 500+ clients across California."
- High volume = high-frequency operations
- Geographic spread = scheduling complexity
- Potential problem: scheduling and route optimization

---

## Method 2: Google Reviews & Yelp

**What to look for:**
- Client complaints about communication
- Mentions of delays or poor follow-up
- Invoicing or billing issues
- Documentation problems

**Why this works:**
External pain (client complaints) often reveals internal pain (operational problems).

**Example review:**
"Great inspection but took 3 weeks to get our report"
- Reveals: Slow documentation process
- Potential problem: Manual report generation

---

## Method 3: Reddit

**Subreddits to check:**
- r/HVAC
- r/Locksmith
- r/PropertyManagement
- r/SmallBusiness
- Industry-specific subs

**What to search:**
- "software recommendations"
- "how do you handle [task]"
- "frustrated with [process]"
- "[industry] pain points"

**Why this works:**
People vent about real problems on Reddit. Raw, unfiltered insights.

**Example post:**
"What do you use for scheduling? We're still using Google Calendar and it's a nightmare"
- Reveals: Manual scheduling problem
- Potential solution: Custom scheduling system

---

## Method 4: Industry Forums

**Where to look:**
- ContractorTalk.com (contractors, trades)
- HVAC-Talk.com (HVAC professionals)
- Industry-specific forums

**What to search:**
Same as Reddit - software complaints, manual processes, operational frustrations

**Why this works:**
More professional than Reddit, still authentic pain points

---

## Method 5: Software Review Sites

**Sites to use:**
- Capterra
- G2
- Software Advice
- GetApp

**Process:**
1. Search "[Industry] software" (e.g., "fire inspection software")
2. Find the top 3-5 software solutions
3. Read 1-star and 2-star reviews
4. Look for common complaints

**What to look for:**
- "Doesn't support [specific feature we need]"
- "Too expensive"
- "Too complicated"
- "Missing [critical functionality]"
- "Customer support is terrible"

**Why this works:**
These complaints = gaps in the market = opportunity for custom solutions

**Example review (1-star):**
"Decent software but doesn't support California AES forms. Had to go back to spreadsheets"
- Reveals: Gap in existing software
- Potential solution: Custom software that DOES support AES forms

---

## Method 6: LinkedIn Research

**What to look for:**
- Company pages (employee count, growth)
- Job postings (what roles are they hiring?)
- Employee titles (who does what?)

**Why job postings matter:**
If they're hiring an "Admin Assistant to handle paperwork," that's a signal:
- They have manual paperwork problem
- It's bad enough to hire someone
- Potential solution: Automate that paperwork

**Example:**
Company posting: "Hiring Administrative Assistant for data entry and report generation"
- Reveals: Manual data entry problem
- High enough volume they need to hire
- Potential solution: Automation software

---

## Method 7: Competitive Analysis

**Process:**
1. Google: "[Industry] software"
2. Find existing solutions
3. Look at their websites and pricing
4. Identify gaps

**What to look for:**
- What features do they ALL lack?
- What's too expensive?
- What industries are underserved?
- What's the minimum price point?

**Why this works:**
If existing software doesn't serve [specific niche], that's your opportunity.

**Example:**
All HVAC software is $50-$200/month but requires 50+ technicians minimum.
- Gap: Small HVAC companies with 5-10 technicians
- Opportunity: Build for the small guys

---

## Method 8: Industry Publications & Blogs

**What to read:**
- Industry magazines (online versions)
- Trade publications
- Industry association websites
- "State of [Industry]" reports

**What to look for:**
- Trends in the industry
- Common challenges mentioned
- Technology adoption rates
- Regulatory changes

**Why this works:**
Gives you context about the industry without being in it.

## How to Use The Compass

Don't research manually if The Compass can help:

**Ask:**
- "Help me research the fire inspection industry"
- "Find opportunities in HVAC"
- "What are common problems in property management?"

**The Compass will use:**
- niche-research skill
- niche-opportunity-finder skill

Let the AI accelerate your research.

## Documenting Your Research

As you research, document:

**For each industry:**
- Common tasks they do
- Frequency of tasks
- Current solutions (software or manual)
- Complaints and pain points
- Potential automation opportunities

**For each problem:**
- Description
- How they currently handle it
- Time it takes
- Frequency
- Value calculation

Use The Compass to organize this as you go.
