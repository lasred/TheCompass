# Mission 1: Problem & Niche Selection

**Objective:** Research three niches sequentially, identify at least one painful problem worth $20K+ in each, then compare all three to determine which offers the best opportunities

**Timeline:** 1 week

**No outreach yet.** This is pure research.

## What You're Doing This Week

1. Learn The Boring Problems Framework
2. Pick 3 industries to explore
3. For EACH industry (sequentially):
   - Research 3-5 businesses online
   - Identify problems using the 4 criteria
   - Calculate problem value
   - Create client avatar
4. Compare all three niches
5. Choose primary niche to pursue
6. Post findings in Basecamp

## The Mission 1 Workflow

You'll complete the **FULL RESEARCH CYCLE** for each of three niches, then compare at the end.

### NICHE #1 (Days 1-2)

**Step 1a: Niche Research**
- **Skill:** niche-research
- **Output:** `/user-workspace/{niche-name}-niche/research.md`

**Step 1b: Opportunity Identification**
- **Skill:** niche-opportunity-finder
- **Output:** `/user-workspace/{niche-name}-niche/opportunities.md`

**Step 1c: Problem Evaluation**
- **Skill:** problem-identifier
- **Output:** `/user-workspace/{niche-name}-niche/problem-evaluation.md`

**Step 1d: Client Avatar**
- **Skill:** client-avatar-builder
- **Output:** `/user-workspace/{niche-name}-niche/client-avatar.md`

---

### NICHE #2 (Days 3-4)

Repeat the full cycle:
- Research → Opportunities → Problem Evaluation → Avatar
- All files saved to `/user-workspace/{niche-2-name}-niche/`

---

### NICHE #3 (Days 5-6)

Repeat the full cycle:
- Research → Opportunities → Problem Evaluation → Avatar
- All files saved to `/user-workspace/{niche-3-name}-niche/`

---

### COMPARISON & CHECKPOINT (Days 6-7)

**Step 5: Compare All Three & Create Checkpoint**
- **Template:** Use `/templates/mission-1-checkpoint.md`
- **Output:** `/user-workspace/mission-1-checkpoint.md`
- **What:** Compare all three niches and choose your primary focus

The Compass guides you through each niche sequentially. Can't skip ahead - complete each niche fully before moving to the next.

## Your Workspace

All your Mission 1 work is saved in `/user-workspace/`:
- This folder is private (gitignored)
- Each niche gets its own folder (e.g., `/user-workspace/hvac-niche/`)
- The Compass creates files as you complete steps
- You can reference these files anytime
- They become your business foundation

**File structure:**
```
/user-workspace/
  /hvac-niche/
    research.md
    opportunities.md
    problem-evaluation.md
    client-avatar.md
  /fire-inspection-niche/
    research.md
    opportunities.md
    problem-evaluation.md
    client-avatar.md
  /property-management-niche/
    research.md
    opportunities.md
    problem-evaluation.md
    client-avatar.md
  mission-1-checkpoint.md
```

When Mission 1 is complete, you'll have:
- ✅ Three fully-researched niches with comparison data
- ✅ Validated problems worth $20K+ in each niche
- ✅ Client avatars for all three opportunities
- ✅ Clear decision on which niche to pursue first
- ✅ Two backup niches if your first choice doesn't validate
- ✅ Documentation to share with community

## Why This Matters

You can't build a business without a customer.

You can't close a customer without a problem worth solving.

Mission 1 teaches you to see opportunities everywhere.

## The 4 Criteria

A problem is worth solving if it meets ALL 4:

1. **Manual Process Hell** - paper, spreadsheets, manual work
2. **High-Frequency Repetition** - 10+ times per month
3. **Compliance or Revenue-Critical** - must do it or can't operate/bill
4. **Terrible Existing Software** - doesn't exist, too expensive, or outdated

**When all 4 are met: This is gold.**

## What Success Looks Like

By end of Week 1, you have:
- ✅ Picked your niche
- ✅ Researched 10-15 businesses
- ✅ Identified 1-3 valuable problems
- ✅ Created client avatar
- ✅ Posted checkpoint in Basecamp

## How The Compass Helps

Use these skills this week:
- **niche-research** - Find untapped opportunities
- **niche-opportunity-finder** - Discover specific problems
- **problem-identifier** - Evaluate against 4 criteria
- **client-avatar-builder** - Define ideal customer

Just ask The Compass: "Help me research [industry]"
