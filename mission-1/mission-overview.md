You'll be guided through 5 steps in sequence:

**Duration:** 1-2 days

### STEP 2: Opportunity Identification (Day 3)
**What:** Find specific problems within your niche
**Skill:** niche-opportunity-finder

**Duration:** Half day

### STEP 3: Problem Evaluation (Days 4-5)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

The Compass guides you through each step. Can't skip ahead - each builds on the previous.

## Your Workspace

All your Mission 1 work is saved in `/user-workspace/`:
- This folder is private (gitignored)
- The Compass creates files as you complete steps
- You can reference these files anytime
- They become your business foundation

When Mission 1 is complete, you'll have:
- ✅ Clear understanding of your niche
- ✅ Validated problems worth $20K+
- ✅ Defined ideal customer
- ✅ Documentation to share with community

## Why This Matters

You can't build a business without a customer.

You can't close a customer without a problem worth solving.

Mission 1 teaches you to see opportunities everywhere.

## The 4 Criteria

A problem is worth solving if it meets ALL 4:

1. **Manual Process Hell** - paper, spreadsheets, manual work
2. **High-Frequency Repetition** - 10+ times per month
3. **Compliance or Revenue-Critical** - must do it or can't operate/bill
4. **Terrible Existing Software** - doesn't exist, too expensive, or outdated

**When all 4 are met: This is gold.**

## What Success Looks Like

By end of Week 1, you have:
- ✅ Picked your niche
- ✅ Researched 10-15 businesses
- ✅ Identified 1-3 valuable problems
