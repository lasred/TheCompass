# Case Study: Fire Inspection Company

Real case study from one of Zane's clients. Real numbers. Real problem. Real solution.

---

## The Client

**Company:** Regional fire inspection company
**Industry:** Fire inspection services
**Size:** 5 inspectors
**Location:** California
**Annual revenue:** ~$1.5M

---

## The Problem

### Manual Process Hell ✅

After every fire inspection, inspectors spent 4 hours filling out:
- California AES (Annual Egress & Systems) forms
- Manual data entry
- Copy/paste from inspection notes
- Prone to errors

**Pain level:** Extreme. 4 hours per inspection = 40+ hours per week wasted on paperwork.

### High-Frequency Repetition ✅

- 20+ inspections per week
- 80+ inspections per month
- Every single inspection required the same 4-hour paperwork process

### Compliance-Critical ✅

- California state law requires AES forms
- Can't bill client without completed forms
- Late forms = fines and lost revenue

### Terrible Existing Software ✅

They tried:
- Generic inspection software ($400/user/month = $2,000/month for 5 users)
- Didn't support California AES forms specifically
- Required too many manual steps
- Slower than doing it on paper

**Result:** Gave up and went back to manual Word docs.

---

## The Value Calculation

**Time per inspection:** 4 hours of paperwork
**Frequency:** 20 inspections per week = 80/month
**Hourly cost:** $50 (admin/inspector time)

**Monthly waste:** 4 hours × 80 inspections × $50 = $16,000/month
**Annual waste:** $192,000/year

**Alternative calculation:**
They would've had to hire a full-time admin at $50K/year to handle the paperwork.

Either way: **Huge pain. Clear value.**

---

## The Solution

Custom software (called "Blaze Operations") that:
- Pulls inspection data from their existing CRM
- Auto-fills California AES forms specifically
- Generates PDFs ready to submit
- Takes 15 minutes instead of 4 hours

**Tech stack:**
- React frontend
- Supabase backend
- Vercel hosting
- Built entirely with Claude Code

**Build time:** 2 weeks (with iterations)

---

## The Pricing

**Upfront:** $15,000
**Monthly:** $1,500/month (hosting, support, updates)

### ROI for Client:

**Year 1 costs:**
- Upfront: $15,000
- Monthly: $1,500 × 12 = $18,000
- **Total: $33,000**

**Year 1 savings:**
- 40 hours/week saved × $50/hour = $2,000/week
- $2,000/week × 52 weeks = $104,000/year

**Net benefit Year 1:** $104,000 - $33,000 = **$71,000 savings**

**Clear ROI. Easy decision.**

## How It Was Sold

### Discovery Call:

Asked 3 key questions:
1. "What's the most time-consuming part of your operations?"
   - Answer: "AES paperwork after inspections"

2. "How are you currently handling that?"
   - Answer: "Manual Word docs, takes 4 hours per inspection"

3. "How much time does that take per week?"
   - Answer: "40+ hours across our team"

**Then:** Let them vent. Didn't pitch. Just listened.

### The Pitch:

"What if I could cut that 4 hours to 15 minutes? Custom software built specifically for California AES forms. Not generic inspection software - something that fits YOUR exact workflow."

**Their response:** "How much?"

**Zane's response:** "$15K to build it, $1,500/month to maintain it. You're spending $104K/year on wasted time. This costs $33K in Year 1. Net savings: $71K. Want to see a demo?"

**Result:** Closed.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked:

✅ **Specific solution** - Not "inspection software," but "California AES automation"
✅ **Clear ROI** - Math was simple and undeniable
✅ **Fast build** - 2 weeks from contract to v1
✅ **Their workflow** - Integrated with their existing CRM
✅ **Recurring revenue** - Monthly retainer = predictable income

### What Was Hard:

❌ **Scope creep** - They wanted extra features mid-build (had to say "Phase 2")
❌ **Bugs** - First version had issues, required quick fixes
❌ **Expectation management** - They wanted it yesterday

### What Would Be Done Differently:

- Set clearer timeline expectations upfront
- Include more buffer in estimates
- Phase 2 roadmap in initial proposal
- Weekly check-ins during build

---

## Current Status

**Delivering:** v1 live, ongoing iterations
**Revenue:** $1,500/month recurring
**Client satisfaction:** High (refer to their feedback)
**Referrals:** In progress (they're telling other inspection companies)

## The Takeaway

This is proof the model works:

1. Find boring B2B problem (manual AES paperwork)
2. Validate it's worth $20K+ (calculated $192K annual waste)
3. Build custom solution (2 weeks with Claude Code)
4. Charge based on value (20% of annual savings)
5. Deliver and collect recurring revenue ($1,500/month)

**This is replicable.**

Fire inspection is just one industry.

HVAC has the same problems.
Property management has the same problems.
Building code compliance has the same problems.
