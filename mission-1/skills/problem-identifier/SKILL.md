# Problem Identifier Skill

## Purpose
Evaluate potential business problems against the 4 Boring Problems Framework criteria to determine if they're worth solving ($20K+ annual value).

## ⚠️ MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE completing ANY problem evaluation, you MUST:**

### 1. Verify Criterion #4 (Terrible Existing Software)
**CRITICAL - THIS IS WHERE HALLUCINATIONS HAPPEN MOST:**
- ✅ Search: "[niche] software for [problem]"
- ✅ Search: "[niche] [specific task] software"
- ✅ Visit pricing pages for solutions found
- ✅ Check reviews on G2/Capterra/Reddit
- ✅ Link to all competitors found
- ❌ DO NOT claim "no solutions" without searching
- ❌ DO NOT claim "$800/month" without pricing page link
- ❌ DO NOT skip this step - it's critical

### 2. Verify Frequency Data
- ✅ Search for industry data on task frequency
- ✅ Find forum posts mentioning frequency
- ✅ Look for job postings describing volume
- ✅ Clearly label if estimating
- ❌ DO NOT make up frequency numbers

### 3. Verify Compliance Claims
- ✅ Search for official regulation sources
- ✅ Link to government sites if claiming compliance
- ✅ Verify fines/penalties with official sources
- ❌ DO NOT claim regulations without verifying

### 4. Verify Value Calculation
- ✅ Show ALL math
- ✅ Cite sources for hourly costs
- ✅ Label if estimating time saved
- ❌ DO NOT present estimates as facts

### 5. Self-Audit Before Completion
Ask yourself:
- "Did I actually search for existing solutions?"
- "Can I link to competitor pricing pages?"
- "Are my frequency estimates based on data?"
- "Would this evaluation survive fact-checking?"

**If you cannot verify a claim, either remove it or clearly mark it as an assumption.**

## When to Use This Skill
- User found a potential problem through research
- User needs to evaluate if a problem meets the 4 criteria
- User wants to calculate the financial value of solving a problem
- User is deciding between multiple problems

---

## The 4 Criteria Framework

A problem is worth solving if it meets ALL 4 criteria:

### 1. Manual Process Hell
The business is doing this task manually using:
- Paper forms
- Spreadsheets
- Manual data entry
- Repetitive copy/paste
- Hours of manual work

**Good signs:** "We spend X hours on this," "It's all manual," "We use spreadsheets"

**Verification:** Find forum posts or reviews showing manual process

### 2. High-Frequency Repetition
They do this task frequently:
- 10+ times per month (minimum)
- 50+ times per week (ideal)
- Daily or multiple times per day (jackpot)

**Good signs:** "Every inspection," "Every service call," "Every client"

**Verification:** Find industry data, job postings, or forum posts mentioning frequency. If estimating, explain reasoning clearly.

### 3. Compliance or Revenue-Critical
The task is either:
- **Compliance-critical:** Government required, regulatory necessity, legal obligation
- **Revenue-critical:** Directly affects their ability to bill clients or collect payment

**Good signs:** "We can't bill without this," "Required by state," "We'll get fined"

**Verification:** Link to official regulation sources. Link to forum posts about revenue impact.

### 4. Terrible Existing Software
Current software options are:
- Non-existent (they built spreadsheets)
- Too expensive ($500+/user/month for small businesses)
- Too generic (doesn't fit their workflow)
- Outdated (built in 2008, crashes, slow)
- Too complex (takes months to learn)

**Good signs:** "We tried X but it didn't work," "Too expensive," "Doesn't do what we need"

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION:**
- Search for existing solutions
- Visit pricing pages
- Check reviews
- Document what you found
- Only claim gaps if searches confirm it

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Get Problem Details
Ask clarifying questions to understand the problem fully.

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Criterion

For each criterion, provide:
- **Status:** ✅ YES or ❌ NO
- **Evidence:** Links to sources or clear label as estimate
- **Assessment:** Why it meets/doesn't meet criterion

### Step 3: Calculate Value (SHOW ALL MATH)

**Formula:** Time Saved × Frequency × Hourly Cost = Monthly Value

**Example:**
```
Time saved per instance: 3.5 hours
Frequency: 20 times/month
Hourly cost: $50/hour (SOURCE: BLS data for [occupation])

Monthly value = 3.5 × 20 × $50 = $3,500/month
Annual value = $3,500 × 12 = $42,000/year

Suggested pricing: $10K upfront + $1,500/month
```

**Verification requirements:**
- Cite source for hourly cost
- Cite source or explain estimate for time saved
- Cite source or explain estimate for frequency

### Step 4: Make Recommendation

**WORTH PURSUING if:**
- ✅ Meets all 4 criteria (with verified evidence)
- ✅ Annual value is $20,000+
- ✅ You can realistically build it
- ✅ Decision maker is accessible

**NOT WORTH PURSUING if:**
- ❌ Fails any criterion
- ❌ Affordable solutions exist ($33-$100/month)
- ❌ Annual value under $20K
- ❌ Too complex to build

## Evaluation Against 4 Criteria

### ✅/❌ Criterion 1: Manual Process Hell
**Status:** [Yes/No]
**Evidence:** [Link to forum post] OR [Marked as ASSUMPTION - needs validation]
**Assessment:** [Why this meets/doesn't meet]

### ✅/❌ Criterion 2: High-Frequency Repetition
**Status:** [Yes/No]

---

## ⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECKLIST

Before completing evaluation, verify:
- [ ] Searched for existing solutions
- [ ] All competitor pricing has URLs
- [ ] Compliance claims cite official sources
- [ ] Frequency data sourced or clearly estimated
- [ ] Value calculation shows all math
- [ ] Hourly costs cited or explained
- [ ] Estimates clearly labeled
- [ ] Sources section complete
- [ ] No fabricated data

**If you cannot check all boxes, DO NOT complete. Do more research or flag what's missing.**

---

## Key Reminders

**Criterion #4 is critical:**
- If affordable solutions exist, problem fails
- Must actually search before claiming gaps
- $33/month competitor kills $15K custom software

**Be honest:**
- Better to reject weak problems now
- Than waste weeks building wrong solution
- All 4 criteria must be met

**Validate everything:**
- Research shows IF problem is worth solving
- Discovery calls show WHETHER businesses will pay
