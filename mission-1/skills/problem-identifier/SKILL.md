# Problem Identifier Skill

## Purpose
Evaluate potential business problems against the Boring Problems Framework to determine if they're worth solving ($20K+ annual value).

## When to Use This Skill
- User found a potential problem through research
- User needs to evaluate if a problem meets the 4 criteria
- User wants to calculate the financial value of solving a problem
- User is deciding between multiple problems

## The 4 Criteria Framework

A problem is worth solving if it meets ALL 4 criteria:

### 1. Manual Process Hell
The business is doing this task manually using:
- Paper forms
- Spreadsheets
- Manual data entry
- Repetitive copy/paste
- Hours of manual work

**Good signs:** "We spend X hours on this," "It's all manual," "We use spreadsheets"

### 2. High-Frequency Repetition
They do this task frequently:
- 10+ times per month (minimum)
- 50+ times per week (ideal)
- Daily or multiple times per day (jackpot)

**Good signs:** "Every inspection," "Every service call," "Every client"

### 3. Compliance or Revenue-Critical
The task is either:
- **Compliance-critical:** Government required, regulatory necessity, legal obligation
- **Revenue-critical:** Directly affects their ability to bill clients or collect payment

**Good signs:** "We can't bill without this," "Required by state," "We'll get fined"

### 4. Terrible Existing Software
Current software options are:
- Non-existent (they built spreadsheets)
- Too expensive ($500+/user/month)
- Too generic (doesn't fit their workflow)
- Outdated (built in 2008, crashes, slow)
- Too complex (takes months to learn)

**Good signs:** "We tried X but it didn't work," "Too expensive," "Doesn't do what we need"

## Evaluation Process

When a user presents a problem, follow this process:

### Step 1: Get Problem Details
Ask clarifying questions:
- "Describe the problem in detail. What are they currently doing?"
- "How often do they do this task?"
- "How much time does it take each time?"
- "Why is this important to their business?"
- "What software have they tried? Why didn't it work?"

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Criterion
Go through each criterion one by one:

**Manual Process Hell:**
- Is it manual? (Yes/No)
- What are they using? (paper, spreadsheets, etc.)
- Explain your reasoning

**High-Frequency Repetition:**
- How often? (X times per month/week/day)
- Does it meet the threshold? (10+ per month minimum)
- Explain your reasoning

**Compliance or Revenue-Critical:**
- Is it required by government/regulation? (Yes/No)
- Does it directly affect billing/revenue? (Yes/No)
- Explain your reasoning

**Terrible Existing Software:**
- What's available now?
- Why doesn't it work for them?
- Explain your reasoning

### Step 3: Calculate Value

Use this formula:

**Time Saved × Frequency × Hourly Cost = Monthly Value**

**Example calculation:**
- Task currently takes: 4 hours
- They do it: 20 times per month
- Their time costs: $50/hour (employee or owner)
- **Monthly value:** 4 × 20 × $50 = $4,000/month
- **Annual value:** $4,000 × 12 = $48,000/year

**Pricing rule:** Charge 20-30% of annual value
- In this example: $10K-$15K upfront + $1,000-$1,500/month

### Step 4: Make Recommendation

Based on evaluation:

**WORTH PURSUING if:**
- ✅ Meets all 4 criteria
- ✅ Annual value is $20,000+ 
- ✅ You can realistically build it with Claude Code
- ✅ Decision maker is accessible

**NOT WORTH PURSUING if:**
- ❌ Fails any of the 4 criteria
- ❌ Annual value is under $20,000
- ❌ Too complex to build (enterprise-level features)
- ❌ Too niche (only 10 potential clients exist)

## Output Format

Always structure your evaluation like this:

```
# Problem Evaluation

**Problem:** [Brief description]
**Industry:** [Industry/niche]
**Business type:** [Size/type of business]

---

## Evaluation Against 4 Criteria

### ✅/❌ Criterion 1: Manual Process Hell
**Status:** [Yes/No]
**Details:** [What they're doing manually]
**Assessment:** [Why this meets/doesn't meet the criterion]

### ✅/❌ Criterion 2: High-Frequency Repetition
**Status:** [Yes/No]
**Frequency:** [X times per month/week/day]
**Assessment:** [Why this meets/doesn't meet the criterion]

### ✅/❌ Criterion 3: Compliance or Revenue-Critical
**Status:** [Yes/No]
**Type:** [Compliance / Revenue / Both / Neither]
**Assessment:** [Why this meets/doesn't meet the criterion]

### ✅/❌ Criterion 4: Terrible Existing Software
**Status:** [Yes/No]
**Current options:** [What exists and why it fails]
**Assessment:** [Why this meets/doesn't meet the criterion]

## Value Calculation

**Time per instance:** [X hours]
**Frequency:** [X times per month]
**Hourly cost:** $[X]

**Monthly value:** $[calculation]
**Annual value:** $[monthly × 12]

**Suggested pricing:**
- Upfront: $[10K-20K range]
- Monthly: $[1K-2K range]

**ROI for client:** 
[Show how much they save vs what they pay]

---

## Recommendation

**VERDICT:** [✅ WORTH PURSUING / ❌ NOT WORTH PURSUING]

**Reasoning:** [Explain why]

**Next steps:** [What they should do]
- If pursuing: "Validate this with 2-3 discovery calls. Confirm businesses will actually pay for this."
- If not pursuing: "Find a different problem. This one doesn't meet the criteria."

---

**Remember:** Post this evaluation in Basecamp and get feedback from Zane and other pioneers before committing to this problem.
```

## Key Reminders

**Be honest in your assessment:**
- Don't force a "yes" if criteria aren't clearly met
- It's better to reject a weak problem now than waste weeks building something nobody wants
- The 4 criteria exist for a reason - all 4 must be met

**Push them to validate:**
- Even if a problem looks good, they need to talk to real businesses
- Encourage them to post in Basecamp for feedback
- Remind them: "This looks promising, but validate it with discovery calls"

**Keep them focused:**
- One great problem is better than three mediocre ones
- Quality over quantity
- Better to spend extra time finding the RIGHT problem

## Common Pitfalls to Watch For

**False positives:**
- Problem seems big but isn't actually costing them money
- They "want" a solution but won't pay for it
- Frequency is lower than claimed
- Existing software is "good enough" even if they complain

**Red flags:**
- "This would be nice to have" (not must-have)
- "Sometimes we do this" (not high-frequency)
- "We've been living with it" (not painful enough)
- "Our boss won't pay for software" (no budget)

## Success Criteria

A problem is validated when:
1. ✅ All 4 criteria clearly met
2. ✅ Annual value $20K+
3. ✅ Realistic to build
4. ✅ Multiple businesses have this problem (not just one)
5. ✅ Decision makers are accessible

**When all 5 are true:** This is gold. Help them move forward.
