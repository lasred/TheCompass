# Niche Research Skill

## Purpose
Transform yourself from industry outsider to insider in 30 minutes through systematic research of forums, Reddit, communities, and industry sources.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE completing ANY niche research output, you MUST:**

### 1. Web Search Requirement
- ✅ Search for actual forum posts, Reddit threads showing pain points
- ✅ Verify industry statistics with sources (market size, business counts)
- ✅ Find and link to actual communities (with member counts if available)
- ✅ Search for existing software solutions before claiming gaps
- ❌ DO NOT make up pain points without evidence
- ❌ DO NOT fabricate community names or sizes
- ❌ DO NOT claim "no solutions exist" without searching

### 2. Source Citation Requirement
EVERY specific claim must:
- Link to its source (forum post, Reddit thread, industry report, pricing page)
- OR be clearly labeled as "ESTIMATE based on [reasoning]"
- Never present estimates as facts

### 3. Evidence for Pain Points
For each pain point identified:
- Find at least 2-3 sources showing this problem (forum posts, Reddit threads, reviews)
- Link to actual posts/threads
- Show pattern across multiple sources
- If you can't find evidence, mark as "Needs validation with discovery calls"

### 4. Competitor Research
Before claiming market gaps:
- Search: "[niche] software for [problem]"
- Search: "[niche] management software"
- Check pricing pages for any solutions found
- Only claim gaps if search shows no good affordable solutions

### 5. Self-Audit Before Completion
Ask yourself:
- "Did I link to actual forum posts and Reddit threads?"
- "Can I provide URLs for every community I mentioned?"
- "Did I search for competitors before claiming gaps?"
- "Are my market size claims sourced or estimated?"

**If you cannot verify a claim, either remove it or clearly mark it as an assumption.**

## When to Use This Skill
- User wants to research a new industry or niche
- User needs to understand an industry before finding problems
- User wants to know where to find prospects
- User needs to learn industry language and pain points

## The Research Framework

When activated, systematically research:

### 1. Where They Hang Out Online

**Find and verify:**
- Industry-specific forums (with URLs and member counts if visible)
- Active subreddits (with subscriber counts)
- Facebook/LinkedIn groups (with member counts if accessible)
- Industry publications (with URLs)
- Annual conferences/events (with URLs to official sites)

**Verification required:**
- Actually search for each forum/community
- Confirm it exists and is active
- Link to it
- Note member count if visible

### 2. Biggest Problems & Pain Points

**Find evidence:**
- Complaint threads on Reddit
- Forum posts about frustrations
- Reviews mentioning specific problems
- "What do you hate about..." discussions

**Verification required:**
- Link to at least 2-3 posts per major pain point
- Show pattern across multiple sources
- Don't list a pain point without evidence

### 3. Language & Lingo

**Capture real language:**
- Technical terms from forum posts
- Pain phrases from complaint threads
- Success phrases from positive posts
- Industry-specific slang

**Verification required:**
- Link to posts showing this language in use
- Don't assume terminology - find examples

### 4. Market Gaps & Opportunities

**Search for existing solutions:**
- "[niche] software"
- "[niche] [specific problem] software"
- Check pricing pages
- Read reviews on G2/Capterra

**Verification required:**
- Document search queries used
- Link to competitors found (or show search results with no good matches)
- Verify pricing before claiming solutions are "too expensive"
- Only claim gaps if you've actually searched

### 5. Current Software Landscape

**Research what exists:**
- Search for competitors
- Visit pricing pages
- Read reviews
- Note what's missing

**Verification required:**
- Link to all competitor pricing pages
- Show actual costs (not estimates)
- Link to reviews showing complaints

## ⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECKLIST

Before completing research, verify:
- [ ] All forums/communities have URLs
- [ ] All pain points have linked evidence
- [ ] All competitor pricing has source links
- [ ] All statistics cite sources or marked as estimates
- [ ] Search queries documented
- [ ] Sources section complete
- [ ] No fabricated data

**If you cannot check all boxes, DO NOT complete the output. Do more research or flag what's missing.**

---

## Key Reminders

**Be honest about limitations:**
- If you can't find evidence for a pain point, say so
- If market size is estimated, label it clearly
- If you didn't find competitors, show your search queries

**Research doesn't replace validation:**
- This gets you 80% there
- Discovery calls get you to 100%
- Always validate with real conversations

**Quality over speed:**
- Better to take extra time and verify everything
- Than to fabricate data and lose credibility
