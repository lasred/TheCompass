# Client Avatar Builder Skill

## Purpose
Help user create a detailed profile of their ideal client to focus their targeting, research, and messaging.

## When to Use This Skill
- User has chosen their niche
- User needs to define their ideal customer before outreach
- User wants to focus their research efforts
- User is preparing for discovery calls (Mission 3)

## Why Client Avatars Matter

A clear client avatar helps you:
- **Focus your research:** Stop wasting time on businesses that can't afford you
- **Craft better messaging:** Speak directly to their pain points
- **Find the right prospects:** Know exactly who to target
- **Close faster:** You understand their business deeply

**Without a clear avatar:** You're fishing in the ocean  
**With a clear avatar:** You're spearing fish in a barrel

## The Client Avatar Framework

### Section 1: Company Profile

**Questions to ask the user:**
1. "What industry are you targeting?" (e.g., fire inspection, HVAC, property management)
2. "What size companies?" (employees and/or annual revenue)
3. "Any specific geography?" (local, state, national)
4. "What's their business model?" (B2B, B2C, or both)

**Good answers are specific:**
- ❌ "Small businesses"
- ✅ "Fire inspection companies with 5-20 employees, $500K-$3M annual revenue, operating in California"

### Section 2: Decision Maker

**Questions to ask:**
1. "Who makes software purchasing decisions?"
2. "What's their typical title?" (Owner, Operations Manager, IT Director, etc.)
3. "What are their daily responsibilities?"
4. "What keeps them up at night?" (top 3 frustrations)

**Why this matters:**
- You need to know WHO to target on LinkedIn
- You need to understand THEIR pain (not just company pain)
- Your outreach message speaks to THEM specifically

**Example:**
- **Title:** Operations Manager
- **Responsibilities:** Scheduling inspectors, compliance reporting, client communication
- **Frustrations:** Manual paperwork taking hours, missing compliance deadlines, can't scale without more admin staff

### Section 3: Current Situation (The Problem)

**Questions to ask:**
1. "How are they currently handling this problem?"
2. "Why does their current solution suck?"
3. "What have they tried before?" (software, hiring, outsourcing)
4. "What's the annual cost of NOT solving this?" (use value calculation)

**This section is critical:**
- It shows you understand their world
- It helps you position your solution
- It identifies the GAP you're filling

**Example:**
- **Current solution:** Spreadsheets + manual data entry
- **Why it sucks:** Takes 4 hours per inspection, prone to errors, can't access from field
- **What they tried:** Looked at [Generic Software] but it was $500/user/month and didn't support AES forms
- **Annual cost:** $48K in wasted admin time

### Section 4: Budget & Buying Capacity

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What's their annual revenue range?"
2. "Do they currently spend money on software?"
3. "What's a reasonable investment for them?" (based on value delivered)
4. "How do they typically make purchasing decisions?" (owner approval, board vote, etc.)

**Reality check:**
- A $300K/year business won't pay $50K upfront
- A $5M/year business won't blink at $20K if you save them $100K
- Know what they can afford BEFORE you pitch

**Example:**
- **Annual revenue:** $1.5M
- **Current software spend:** $5K/year on CRM
- **Reasonable investment:** $15K upfront + $1,500/month (saves them $48K/year)
- **Decision process:** Owner approves anything under $20K immediately

### Section 5: Success Metrics (What They Care About)

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What results matter most to them?"
2. "How do they measure success?"
3. "What would make this a no-brainer investment?"

**Common success metrics:**
- **Time saved:** "Cut paperwork from 4 hours to 15 minutes"
- **Compliance:** "Never miss a deadline, avoid fines"
- **Revenue:** "Can take on 30% more clients without hiring"
- **Cost reduction:** "Eliminate $50K admin position"

**Your solution = their success metric**

### Section 6: Messaging & Positioning

Based on everything above, define:
1. **Lead with:** Their #1 pain point
2. **Emphasize:** The specific outcome they care about
3. **Differentiate:** Why you're better than alternatives
4. **Proof:** Similar businesses you've helped (or will help)

**Example messaging:**
- **Lead with:** "Spending 4+ hours on AES paperwork after every inspection?"
- **Emphasize:** "We'll cut that to 15 minutes—automate your compliance reporting completely"
- **Differentiate:** "Unlike generic software, this is built specifically for California fire inspectors"
- **Proof:** "Already saving California Blaze Protection 40 hours per week"

## Output Format

When building a client avatar, present it like this:

```
# Client Avatar: [Industry/Niche]

## Company Profile
- **Industry:** [specific industry]
- **Size:** [employee count and/or revenue]
- **Location:** [geography if relevant]
- **Business model:** [B2B/B2C/Both]
- **Typical characteristics:** [any other relevant details]

## Decision Maker Profile
- **Title:** [their role]
- **Responsibilities:** [what they handle daily]
- **Top 3 frustrations:**
  1. [pain point 1]
  2. [pain point 2]
  3. [pain point 3]
- **What keeps them up at night:** [their biggest worry]

## Current Situation
- **How they handle the problem now:** [current solution]
- **Why it's not working:** [specific pain points]
- **What they've tried before:** [failed solutions]
- **Annual cost of not solving:** $[value calculation]

## Budget & Buying Capacity
- **Annual revenue range:** $[range]
- **Current software spend:** $[amount]/year
- **Reasonable investment:** $[upfront] + $[monthly]/month
- **ROI justification:** [how you justify the price]
- **Decision process:** [who approves, how long it takes]

## Success Metrics
What matters most to them:
1. **Primary metric:** [time saved / compliance / revenue / cost]
2. **Secondary metric:** [supporting benefit]
3. **Ultimate goal:** [bigger picture outcome]

## Your Solution
- **What you'll build:** [brief description]
- **Value delivered:** [specific outcomes in their language]
- **Pricing:** $[upfront] + $[monthly]/month
- **ROI:** [show the math: they save $X, they pay $Y, net benefit $Z]

## Messaging Strategy

**Opening line (email/LinkedIn):**
"[Lead with their #1 pain point in their own words]"

**Value proposition:**
"[What you do + specific outcome + differentiation]"

**Example:**
"Spending 4+ hours on AES paperwork after every inspection? I build custom software that cuts compliance reporting to 15 minutes—built specifically for California fire inspectors, not generic inspection tools."

**Call to action:**
"Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to discuss how other fire inspection companies are saving 40+ hours per week on paperwork?"

---

## Next Steps

**For the user:**
1. Save this avatar—you'll reference it constantly
2. Use this to focus your research (only look at businesses matching this profile)
3. Test your messaging assumptions with discovery calls
4. Refine as you learn more

**Remember:** This avatar will evolve. After your first 3-5 discovery calls, you'll refine it based on what you learn.
```

## Guidance for The Compass

When helping a user build their avatar:

**Start broad, then narrow:**
- Don't let them say "all small businesses"
- Push for specificity: size, location, characteristics
- The more specific, the better

**Connect to their problem:**
- The avatar should be built around the problem they identified
- If the problem is "fire inspection paperwork," the avatar is "fire inspection companies that do manual paperwork"
- Avatar + Problem = Target

**Challenge vague answers:**
- "What size companies?" → "Um, small ones" → "What's 'small'? 5 employees? 20? 100?"
- Be specific. Force clarity.

**Use their research:**
- "Based on the businesses you researched, what's the common profile?"
- "Who did you find that has this problem?"
- Build the avatar from reality, not theory

**One avatar at a time:**
- Don't let them create 3 different avatars
- Pick ONE target, nail it, then expand later
- Focus = success

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too broad:**
- ❌ "Small businesses that need software"
- ✅ "HVAC companies with 10-30 employees doing 100+ service visits per week"

**Unrealistic budget:**
- Don't target businesses that can't afford you
- $500K revenue → probably won't pay $20K
- $5M revenue → $20K is reasonable if ROI is clear

**Ignoring decision makers:**
- You need to know WHO to target
- "The company" doesn't buy software
- The Operations Manager or Owner does

**Not connecting to the problem:**
- Avatar should be built around the problem
- If problem is "manual scheduling," avatar needs to be "companies that do lots of scheduling"

## Success Criteria

A good client avatar:
1. ✅ Specific enough to guide your research
2. ✅ Connected to the problem you're solving
3. ✅ Has realistic budget capacity
4. ✅ Decision maker is clearly defined
5. ✅ Messaging speaks to their pain directly

**When these are true:** You know exactly who to target and how to reach them.

**Action after creating avatar:**
"Great work, [name]! Now use this avatar to focus your research. Only look at businesses that match this profile. And when you start outreach in Mission 3, you'll know exactly what to say."

**Push to Basecamp:**
"Post this avatar in Basecamp and get feedback. Other pioneers might know this niche or spot something you missed."
