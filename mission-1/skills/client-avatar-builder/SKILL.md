# Client Avatar Builder Skill

## Purpose
Help user create a detailed profile of their ideal client to focus their targeting, research, and messaging.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE completing ANY client avatar, you MUST:**

### 1. Verify Company Characteristics
- ✅ Search for industry data on typical company sizes
- ✅ Find revenue ranges from industry reports
- ✅ Verify employee counts with BLS or industry data
- ✅ Clearly label estimates
- ❌ DO NOT make up company profiles

### 2. Verify Decision Maker Roles
- ✅ Search job postings in the industry
- ✅ Check LinkedIn for actual titles
- ✅ Find forum discussions about buying decisions
- ❌ DO NOT assume who makes decisions

### 3. Verify Budget Capacity
- ✅ Show ROI calculations with sourced data
- ✅ Find industry profit margins
- ✅ Calculate budget based on verified revenue
- ✅ Clearly label estimates
- ❌ DO NOT claim affordability without reasoning

### 4. Verify Resources
- ✅ Search for associations and link to them
- ✅ Find directories and verify they exist
- ✅ Find groups and note member counts
- ❌ DO NOT list fictional resources

### 5. Self-Audit Before Completion
Ask yourself:
- "Can I link to sources for company size claims?"
- "Did I verify decision maker roles?"
- "Is budget estimate based on calculations?"
- "Would this avatar survive fact-checking?"

**If you cannot verify a claim, either remove it or clearly mark it as an assumption.**

## When to Use This Skill

- User needs to define their ideal customer before outreach
- User wants to focus their research efforts

## Why Client Avatars Matter

- **Focus your research:** Stop wasting time on businesses that can't afford you
- **Craft better messaging:** Speak directly to their pain points

- **Close faster:** You understand their business deeply

**Without a clear avatar:** You're fishing in the ocean
**With a clear avatar:** You're spearing fish in a barrel

## The Client Avatar Framework

### Section 1: Company Profile

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What industry are you targeting?"
2. "What size companies?" (employees and/or annual revenue)
3. "Any specific geography?"
4. "What's their business model?"

**Good answers are specific:**
- ❌ "Small businesses"
- ✅ "Fire inspection companies with 5-20 employees, $500K-$3M annual revenue, operating in California"

**Verification required:**
- Search for industry size data
- Cite sources for revenue ranges
- Mark as estimates if no data found

### Section 2: Decision Maker

**Questions to ask:**
1. "Who makes software purchasing decisions?"
2. "What's their typical title?"
3. "What are their daily responsibilities?"
4. "What keeps them up at night?"

**Verification required:**
- Search job postings for actual titles
- Check LinkedIn profiles
- Find forum discussions about decision makers
- Don't assume - verify

### Section 3: Current Situation

**Questions to ask:**
1. "How are they currently handling this problem?"
2. "Why does their current solution suck?"
3. "What have they tried before?"
4. "What's the annual cost of NOT solving this?"

**Verification required:**
- Find forum posts showing current tools
- Link to complaints about current solutions
- Show value calculation with sources

### Section 4: Budget & Buying Capacity

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What's their annual revenue range?"
2. "Do they currently spend money on software?"
3. "What's a reasonable investment for them?"
4. "How do they typically make purchasing decisions?"

**Verification required:**
- Show ROI calculation
- Cite sources for revenue data
- Explain budget estimate methodology
- Clearly label what's estimated

### Section 5: Success Metrics

**Questions to ask:**
1. "What results matter most to them?"
2. "How do they measure success?"
3. "What would make this a no-brainer investment?"

### Section 6: Messaging & Positioning

Based on everything above, define:
1. **Lead with:** Their #1 pain point
2. **Emphasize:** The specific outcome they care about
3. **Differentiate:** Why you're better than alternatives
4. **Proof:** Similar businesses you've helped

## ⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECKLIST

Before completing avatar, verify:
- [ ] Company size/revenue cited or marked as estimate
- [ ] Decision maker verified via LinkedIn/job postings
- [ ] Budget calculation shows the math
- [ ] All associations/directories have URLs
- [ ] Estimates clearly labeled
- [ ] Sources section complete
- [ ] No fabricated profiles

**If you cannot check all boxes, DO NOT complete. Do more research or flag what's missing.**

---

## Guidance for The Compass

**Start broad, then narrow:**
- Push for specificity
- The more specific, the better

**Connect to their problem:**
- Avatar built around problem identified
- Avatar + Problem = Target

**Challenge vague answers:**
- Force clarity
- No "small businesses" allowed

**One avatar at a time:**
- Pick ONE target, nail it
- Focus = success

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too broad:**
- ❌ "Small businesses that need software"
- ✅ "HVAC companies with 10-30 employees doing 100+ service visits per week"

**Unrealistic budget:**
- Don't target businesses that can't afford you
- Know what they can afford BEFORE you pitch

**Ignoring decision makers:**
- Know WHO to target
- Understand THEIR authority level

---

## Success Criteria

A good client avatar:
1. ✅ Specific enough to guide research
2. ✅ Connected to problem you're solving
3. ✅ Has realistic budget capacity (with calculation)
4. ✅ Decision maker clearly defined (verified)
5. ✅ Messaging speaks to their pain

**When these are true:** You know exactly who to target and how to reach them.

**Remember:** This avatar evolves. After 3-5 discovery calls, refine it based on learnings.
