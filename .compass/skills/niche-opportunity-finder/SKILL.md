# Niche Opportunity Finder Skill

## Purpose
Find profitable $15K+ client opportunities in specific niches by identifying boring problems with verified pain points and proven market demand.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE completing ANY opportunity analysis, you MUST:**

### 1. Verify Industry Data
- ✅ Search for market size, business counts
- ✅ Find industry reports or census data
- ✅ Cite sources for all statistics
- ❌ DO NOT make up market sizes

### 2. Verify Competitor Landscape
- ✅ Search: "[niche] software for [problem]"
- ✅ Visit actual pricing pages
- ✅ Check reviews on G2/Capterra/Reddit
- ✅ Only claim gaps after searching
- ❌ DO NOT assume gaps without evidence

### 3. Verify Pain Points
- ✅ Find Reddit posts, forum threads showing the problem
- ✅ Link to at least 2-3 sources per pain point
- ✅ Show pattern across multiple sources
- ❌ DO NOT list pain points without evidence

### 4. Verify Budget Estimates
- ✅ Show ROI calculations with sourced data
- ✅ Base estimates on verified industry data
- ✅ Clearly label what's estimated vs. verified
- ❌ DO NOT claim affordability without reasoning

### 5. Self-Audit Before Completion
Ask yourself:
- "Did I actually search for competitors?"
- "Can I link to evidence for these pain points?"
- "Are my pricing claims verified with URLs?"
- "Would this hold up if someone fact-checked it?"

**If you cannot verify a claim, either remove it or clearly mark it as an assumption.**
