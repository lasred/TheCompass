# Problem Evaluation: Workflow Visibility & Engagement Tracking for Accounting Firms

**Problem:** Accounting firms with 2+ employees can't see what's happening across the firm—which engagements are on track, which are at risk of missing deadlines, and who has capacity to take on more work.

**Industry:** Small Accounting & CPA Firms

**Business type:** 2-20 person accounting/tax firms with 50+ active engagements

**Evaluated:** November 11, 2025

## Evaluation Against 4 Criteria

### ✅ Criterion 1: Manual Process Hell

**Status:** YES - Highly manual, scattered process

**Details:** Current process for most firms:
1. Managing partner asks staff: "Where are we on the Johnson tax return?"
2. Staff member checks their email, files, memory
3. Responds verbally or via Slack/email
4. Partner writes it down or remembers it
5. Repeat for every single engagement
6. Weekly status meetings to check on everything (3-5 hours/week)
7. Tracking in spreadsheets, whiteboards, or just memory
8. No real-time view of team capacity or workload balance

**Current tools used:**
- Excel spreadsheets with engagement lists
- Whiteboards in office
- Email threads
- Slack/Teams messages
- Weekly status meetings
- Memory

**Assessment:**
This is manual process hell, but one level removed from pure data entry. It's "coordination hell"—the manual work is asking people, tracking responses, updating spreadsheets, and holding meetings. The mental overhead of "I don't know what's happening" creates constant stress.

Not as tactile as "entering data into spreadsheets" but still qualifies as manual because there's no automated system providing real-time visibility.

**Evidence from research:**
- "Missing deadlines without knowing it"
- "Losing track of tasks as workload grows"
- "No visibility into ongoing work"
- "Making file notes is the first habit to slip when busy"
- 55.5% of firm owners experience workflow inefficiencies

---

### ✅ Criterion 2: High-Frequency Repetition

**Status:** YES - Constant, daily problem

**Frequency:**
- **Daily:** Managing partner checks status of 5-10 engagements
- **Weekly:** Status meetings with team (1-2 meetings per week)
- **Per engagement:** Status checks happen 3-5 times throughout lifecycle
- **Annual:** If firm has 200 engagements/year × 4 status checks each = 800 status checks/year

**Detailed frequency breakdown:**
- Firm with 50 active engagements at any time
- Partner checks on 5-10 per day = 25-50 checks per week = 100-200 per month
- Plus weekly status meetings = 4 per month × 1-2 hours each = 4-8 hours/month in meetings

**Assessment:**
This easily exceeds the 10+ times per month threshold. In fact, it happens multiple times PER DAY. Every time a managing partner wonders "Are we going to miss a deadline?" or "Who has capacity?" they're experiencing this pain.

The problem is continuous during busy season and frequent year-round.

**Evidence from research:**
- "Continuous problem during busy season, tax season"
- "55.5% of firm owners experience workflow inefficiencies"
- Status meetings happen weekly or more often
- Daily question: "Where are we on X engagement?"

---

### ⚠️ Criterion 3: Compliance or Revenue-Critical

**Status:** PARTIAL - More revenue-critical than compliance-critical

**Type:** Revenue-Critical (indirect)

**Revenue aspect:**
- **Missed deadlines = lost clients:** If engagement falls through cracks, client may leave ($5K-$50K lifetime value)
- **Inefficient utilization = lost revenue:** If one staff member is overloaded while another has capacity, firm loses billable hours
- **Rush fees avoided:** Better visibility prevents last-minute scrambles that require rush work (which often isn't billable)
- **Client retention:** Better deadline management = happier clients = retention

**Compliance aspect:**
- **Indirect:** Missing a tax deadline IS compliance-critical, but the workflow tracking itself is not directly mandated by law
- Workflow visibility is a TOOL to prevent compliance issues, not itself a compliance requirement

**Assessment:**
This is revenue-critical, but it's one step removed from direct revenue impact.

It's not like document collection where "no docs = can't bill." Instead, it's "bad workflow visibility = missed deadlines, inefficiency, lost clients."

The impact is real and measurable, but it's indirect. You have to explain the chain: "Bad visibility → missed deadline → unhappy client → lost client → lost revenue."

This is the weakest of the 4 criteria for this problem. It DOES meet the bar (revenue-critical), but not as strongly as document collection.

**Evidence from research:**
- "Missed deadlines, unhappy clients"
- "Leads to rushed work, missed deadlines, unhappy clients"
- "Burnout, missed deadlines, uneven utilization"
- Impact on revenue is real but indirect

---

### ✅ Criterion 4: Terrible Existing Software

**Status:** YES - Existing solutions don't fit solo/small firms

**Current options and why they fail:**

1. **Karbon** ($89/user/month)
   - **Problem:** Too expensive for small firms
   - **Cost:** 10-person firm = $10,680/year
   - **Problem:** Steep learning curve, takes weeks to set up
   - **Gap:** Overkill for firms under 10 people

2. **TaxDome** ($50-$300/month depending on features)
   - **Problem:** Overcomplicated, features feel underdeveloped
   - **Problem:** Too many features, hard to learn
   - **Gap:** Tries to do everything, doesn't excel at workflow visibility

3. **Jetpack Workflow** ($30-$59/month)
   - **Problem:** Too basic—lacks real-time capacity view
   - **Problem:** No team capacity dashboard
   - **Gap:** Shows tasks but not who's overloaded vs has capacity

4. **Practice management tools (generic)**
   - **Problem:** Built for mid-size firms (20-50 people)
   - **Problem:** Expensive and complex
   - **Gap:** Small firms (2-10 people) underserved

5. **What most firms actually use:** Excel + meetings
   - **Problem:** Spreadsheets go stale immediately
   - **Problem:** Status meetings waste 3-5 hours/week
   - **Problem:** No real-time view

**Assessment:**
The market has options, but they're either:
- Too expensive for 2-10 person firms
- Too complex (designed for larger firms)
- Too basic (missing real-time capacity view)

The gap: A simple, affordable, real-time workflow dashboard specifically for 2-10 person accounting firms with a focus on:
- Engagement status at a glance
- Team capacity view (who's overloaded, who has room)
- Deadline alerts
- Under $200/month

This gap exists but is narrower than document collection. There ARE tools (Karbon, TaxDome), they're just not ideal for small firms.

**Evidence from research:**
- "Current tools either too complex (Karbon) or too basic (Jetpack Workflow)"
- "Missing: Real-time team capacity view"
- "Karbon: $89/user/month = $1,068/year solo, $10,680 for 10 users - Too expensive"

## Value Calculation

### Time Saved:

**Current manual process (per week):**
- Daily status checks: 30 min/day × 5 days = 2.5 hours/week
- Weekly status meeting: 2 hours/week
- Ad-hoc "where are we on X?" questions: 1 hour/week
- **Total time per week:** 5.5 hours

**With automated dashboard:**
- Daily dashboard check: 5 min/day × 5 days = 25 min/week (0.4 hours)
- Weekly status meeting: Eliminated or reduced to 30 min
- Ad-hoc questions: Mostly eliminated (people check dashboard)
- **Total time per week:** 1 hour

**Time saved per week:** 4.5 hours

---

### Calculation for Small Firm (5 people, managing partner at $100/hour):

**Time saved:**
- 4.5 hours/week × 50 weeks/year = 225 hours/year

**Hourly cost:**
- Managing partner time: $100/hour (fully loaded cost)

**Annual value (time savings alone):**
- 225 hours × $100/hour = **$22,500/year**

---

### Additional Value Beyond Time Savings:

1. **Prevent missed deadlines:**
   - One missed deadline = lost client = $5,000-$50,000 lifetime value
   - Even preventing ONE missed deadline every 2-3 years pays for software

2. **Better utilization:**
   - If 10% of billable hours are lost to poor workload balancing, that's significant
   - Firm with $500K revenue, 10% improvement = **$50,000 additional revenue**
   - Even 2-3% improvement = $10K-$15K

3. **Reduce burnout & turnover:**
   - Replacing one staff accountant = $10K-$20K recruiting/training
   - Better workload balance = retention

4. **Client satisfaction:**
   - Fewer missed deadlines = happier clients = better retention + referrals

**Total annual value (comprehensive):**
- Time savings: $22,500/year
- Utilization improvement: $10,000-$50,000/year (2-10% improvement)
- Turnover prevention: $10,000-$20,000/year (if prevents one departure)

**Conservative total: $25,000-$40,000/year**
**Realistic total: $35,000-$90,000/year**

## Suggested Pricing

**Monthly SaaS:**
- **$79/month** for solo + 1 staff (2 users)
- **$149/month** for 2-10 users
- **$299/month** for 11-25 users

**Annual pricing:**
- $948/year (2 users)
- $1,788/year (2-10 users)
- $3,588/year (11-25 users)

**ROI for client (5-person firm example):**
- Annual cost: $1,788
- Annual value: $35,000 (conservative estimate)
- **ROI: 19.6x** (they get $35K value for $1.8K cost)
- Pays for itself in less than 3 weeks

**Pricing justification:**
- Saves 4.5 hours/week for managing partner
- At $100/hour value = $450/week = $1,800/month potential value
- $149/month is 8% of the value delivered

## Recommendation

**VERDICT:** ✅ **WORTH PURSUING - GOOD OPPORTUNITY**

**Reasoning:**

This problem scores **3.5 out of 4** on the Boring Problems Framework:

1. ✅ **Manual Process Hell:** Excel, whiteboards, meetings, constant asking around
2. ✅ **High-Frequency Repetition:** Daily status checks, weekly meetings—constant problem
3. ⚠️ **Compliance & Revenue-Critical:** Revenue-critical (indirectly), not compliance-mandated
4. ✅ **Terrible Existing Software:** Either too expensive, too complex, or too basic for small firms

**Strengths:**
- High-value problem ($35K-$90K annual value)
- Constant pain (daily problem, not seasonal)
- Clear ROI (time saved + better utilization)
- Market gap for 2-10 person firms (Karbon too expensive, Jetpack too basic)
- 55.5% of firms have workflow inefficiencies (large market)

**Weaknesses compared to Document Collection:**
- Criterion #3 is weaker (indirect revenue impact vs direct)
- More competition exists (Karbon, TaxDome, Jetpack)
- Harder to explain ROI (multi-step: visibility → prevent deadline → keep client)
- Requires multi-user features (more complex to build)
- Targets slightly larger firms (2-10 people) vs universal problem

**Value range:** $35,000-$90,000/year
- Well above the $20K threshold
- At $149/month pricing, client ROI is 19x
- Strong value proposition

**Buildability:** Medium-High complexity
- Real-time dashboard (frontend)
- Multi-user system with permissions
- Engagement tracking database
- Notification system (email/Slack)
- Team capacity calculations
- More complex than document collection

**Market size:** Smaller subset
- Firms with 2-20 employees (not solo firms)
- Maybe 20,000-30,000 firms in this range
- Still large enough

## Comparison to Document Collection

| Factor | Document Collection | Workflow Visibility |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Manual Process Hell** | ✅ Pure manual chaos | ✅ Coordination chaos |
| **High-Frequency** | ✅ 100-300x/year | ✅ Daily |
| **Compliance/Revenue** | ✅ Both (direct) | ⚠️ Revenue only (indirect) |
| **Bad Software** | ✅ No good options | ✅ Options exist but flawed |
| **Annual Value** | $15K-$30K | $35K-$90K |
| **Build Complexity** | Medium | Medium-High |
| **Market Size** | All firms (88K) | 2-20 person firms (~25K) |
| **Competition** | Low-Medium | Medium |
| **Your Advantage** | Friend can test | Need 2-10 person firm |

**Document Collection is stronger overall** because:
- All 4 criteria perfectly met (vs 3.5)
- Universal problem (every firm size)
- Easier to explain ROI (direct time savings)
- Simpler to build (no multi-user complexity)
- Lower competition

**Workflow Visibility has advantages:**
- Higher annual value ($35K vs $15K)
- Higher price point ($149 vs $99)
- Less seasonal (constant problem vs tax season peak)

## Next Steps

### If You Choose This Problem:

1. **Validate with 2-10 person firms:**
   - Ask your friend: Do you know any 3-5 person CPA firms?
   - Interview 2-3 managing partners
   - Ask: "How do you track which engagements are on track vs at risk?"
   - Calculate: "How much time do you spend in status meetings?"
   - Pricing: "Would you pay $149/month for a real-time dashboard?"

2. **Build Prototype:**
   - Simple engagement tracker
   - Team capacity view
   - Deadline alerts
   - Test with 1-2 beta firms

3. **Validate ROI:**
   - Did it reduce status meetings?
   - Did it prevent a missed deadline?
   - Would they pay for it ongoing?

### If You Choose Document Collection Instead:

This is still a great problem, just slightly weaker than document collection. If you want the highest-probability first win, **go with document collection**. If you want higher contract value and don't mind slightly more complexity, **workflow visibility works**.

## Red Flags to Watch For

During validation, watch for:

❌ **"We tried Karbon, it works fine"** - If existing tools solve it well enough, hard to displace
❌ **"Only a problem during busy season"** - If it's seasonal, harder to justify year-round subscription
❌ **"We just ask around, it's not that bad"** - If they don't feel the pain acutely, won't pay
❌ **"Solo firm, don't need this"** - You need 2+ person firms for this to matter

**If you hear 2+ during discovery, reconsider.**

---

## Summary

**Problem:** Workflow visibility & engagement tracking for accounting firms

**Status:** ✅ 3.5/4 criteria met (strong but not perfect)

**Value:** $35K-$90K annually per firm

**Pricing:** $149-$299/month (19-50x ROI for client)

**Market:** ~25,000 firms with 2-20 employees

**Competition:** Medium (Karbon, TaxDome exist but have gaps)

**Your advantage:** Friend can introduce you to multi-person firms

**Verdict:** **GOOD OPPORTUNITY** (but Document Collection is stronger)

**Next action:** If you want to pursue this, validate with 2-3 multi-person firms. If Document Collection feels stronger, go with that first.

### Critical Issues

⚠️ **MAJOR PROBLEM: Financial Cents Already Offers This at $39-69/month**

The document proposes $149-299/month for workflow visibility, but:
- **Financial Cents offers workflow management for $39-69/user/month**
- This is 2-5x CHEAPER than proposed pricing
- Why would firms pay $149-299 when Financial Cents exists at $39-69?

**Questions to answer:**
1. What does Financial Cents lack that firms need?
2. Have firms tried it? Why don't they use it?
3. Is the problem really a "gap in the market" or adoption/awareness?

### Estimates & Assumptions

**ALL ROI Calculations Are Unverified:**
- **3-5 hours/week in status meetings**: ESTIMATE - Not measured with actual firms
- **$200/hour manager rate**: ASSUMPTION - Likely too high for small firms
- **$35K-$90K annual value**: DERIVED from unverified assumptions
- **5-10% better utilization**: ASSUMPTION - No empirical basis
- **$50K additional revenue claim**: HYPOTHETICAL calculation
- **19-50x ROI**: Based on all the above unverified estimates

**Market Size:**
- **~25,000 firms with 2-20 employees**: ESTIMATE - No source provided

**Pricing:**
- **$149-299/month**: NOT validated with target customers
- **No willingness-to-pay research**

### Additional Research Needed

1. **Test Financial Cents** ($39-69/month):
   - Sign up and use for 1 month
   - What does it do well?
   - What's missing that firms need?

2. **Test Jetpack Workflow** ($30-50/month):
   - Even cheaper than Financial Cents
   - Why isn't everyone using it?

3. **Conduct discovery calls** with 5-10 multi-person firms:
   - Do they actually spend 3-5 hours/week in status meetings?
   - What tools do they currently use?
   - Why haven't they adopted existing affordable solutions?
   - What would they pay for workflow visibility?

4. **Validate utilization claims**:
   - Do firms actually achieve 5-10% better utilization with software?
   - Get case studies or data from existing tool users

### Red Flags & Warnings

⚠️ **Pricing contradiction**: Proposes $149-299/month when competitors offer $30-69/month

⚠️ **No competitor testing**: Haven't used Financial Cents, Jetpack, or other tools to verify gaps

⚠️ **All value claims are estimates**: No actual measurement of time saved or revenue improved

⚠️ **Revised Verdict**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES VALIDATION** - Pain is real but affordable solutions may already exist

**Do NOT build until validating why existing $30-69/month solutions aren't being used.**
