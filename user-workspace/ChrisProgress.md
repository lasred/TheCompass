## Questions for Basecamp / Zane

1. Is $99/month too cheap for $15K-$30K value? Or just right?
2. Should I build email-only MVP first, or email + SMS from day 1?
3. How many discovery calls before building? 3-5 enough or need 10+?
4. How do I differentiate from ContentSnare beyond "built for accountants"?
