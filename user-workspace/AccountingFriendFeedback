Friend feedback 

painpoints - Friend emphaszied #4. Especially during tax season. If there are ways to fix tax season(heavily affects him and other accountants). If you can show how it save time during tax season/ etc this would sell big time . He did say #1 and #9 are good ones. 

Opportunities - Opportunity #1 is good. #2 - Needed but so many tech companies already solving for this . #3 - Similar reasoning - so many people doing this. #4 - Friend likes this. Something there would sell for sure. #5- Already realy good apps for this

My friend likes ### 9. **Client Cash Flow Support** 💀 too so we should have an opportunity for this - he thinks it can be sold if it can be done correctly. This could be more generalized too - SAAS for normal everyday people.(Difficulty in marketing)

My friend definitely emphasizes the pain of the tax season

Can we re-prioritize based on my friend's feedback?

Some custom instructions 


1. Reorganize pain points 
2. Reorganize opportunities and create one for ### 9. **Client Cash Flow Support** 
3. Rename problem-evaluation* to opportunity-evaluation*
4. Keep problem/opportunity evaluation 1 but replace the other two in favor of #4 - ## Opportunity #4: Tax Season Capacity Planning & Client Prioritization ⭐⭐⭐⭐
and something to solve ### 9. **Client Cash Flow Support** 💀
5. Adjust the documentation following this based off the changes you're making - I think my-client-avatar and mission-1-checkpoint
