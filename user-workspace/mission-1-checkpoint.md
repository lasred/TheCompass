# Mission 1 Checkpoint: Letian Sun

**Date:** November 23, 2025
**Revenue Goal:** $10,000/month

---

## The Two Patterns I'm Pursuing

After researching multiple opportunities, I've identified **two proven patterns** that consistently generate $150K+ annual value:

1. **Form-based Automation** - Government-mandated or high-frequency standardized forms
2. **Lawyer Chatbot** - Knowledge base that saves professional time + gives clients 24/7 access

Both patterns will be validated in parallel during Mission 2.

---

## 1. Pattern #1: Form-Based Automation

### The Formula

Opportunities worth pursuing meet this threshold:

```
(Frequency per month) × (Hours per form) × (Hourly rate) × 12 ≥ $150,000/year
```

### The 4 Criteria (ALL Required)

1. ✅ **Manual Process Hell** - Done by hand, paper forms, spreadsheets, hours of manual work
2. ✅ **High-Frequency** - 10+ times per month (ideally daily or weekly)
3. ✅ **Compliance/Revenue-Critical** - Required by government, directly affects billing, can't skip it
4. ✅ **Terrible Software** - Nonexistent, too expensive ($500+/month), outdated, or doesn't fit workflow

### Proven Examples (From Research)

**Option A: Fire Inspection (California AES Forms)**
- **Form:** California AES (Automatic Fire Extinguishing System) inspection reports
- **Frequency:** 80 inspections/month
- **Time per form:** 4 hours
- **Annual savings:** $192,000/year
- **Who needs it:** Fire inspection companies in California

**Option B: Home Health (Medicare OASIS Forms)**
- **Form:** OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set)
- **Frequency:** 150-450 forms/month (5-15 RN agency)
- **Time per form:** 3-3.5 hours
- **Annual savings:** $243,000-$729,000/year
- **Who needs it:** Home health agencies billing Medicare

**Option C: Physician Practices (Prior Authorizations)**
- **Form:** Insurance prior authorization requests
- **Frequency:** 540-900 forms/month (3-5 physician practice)
- **Time per form:** 12-14 hours/week total staff time
- **Annual savings:** $204,000-$680,000/year
- **Who needs it:** Physician practices, specialists

### Other Potential Industries (To Explore in Mission 2)

**Inspection Companies:**
- Elevator inspections (state/city-mandated reports)
- Property inspections (pre-purchase, rental, commercial)
- Safety inspections (workplace safety, equipment)
- Building inspections (code compliance)
- Environmental inspections (EPA compliance)

**Home Services:**
- HVAC service reports (after every service call)
- Pest control service reports (after every treatment)
- Property management (maintenance reports, inspections)
- Pool service reports (cleaning/chemical treatment)
- Appliance repair reports (after every repair)

**Other:**
- Waste management (route documentation, hazardous waste forms)
- Contractors (daily job reports, change orders, safety meetings)

### Client Avatar (Form-Based Pattern)

**Multiple potential avatars - to be validated in Mission 2:**

**Avatar Option A: Fire Inspector**
- Small fire inspection company (5-10 inspectors)
- 80-200 inspections/month
- Currently using Word docs or paper forms
- 4 hours per AES report
- $50/hour billable rate
- Pain: Inspectors spend half their time on paperwork instead of inspections

**Avatar Option B: Home Health Agency Owner**
- 5-15 RNs on staff
- 150-450 OASIS assessments/month
- Currently using EHR with manual OASIS entry
- 3-3.5 hours per OASIS
- $45/hour RN cost
- Pain: Nurses spend 26% of time on paperwork instead of patient care

**Avatar Option C: Physician Practice Manager**
- 3-10 physicians
- 540-900 prior auths/month
- Dedicated staff working only on prior auths
- 12-14 hours/week per physician
- $40/hour staff cost
- Pain: Hiring dedicated staff just for prior auth paperwork

## 2. Pattern #2: Lawyer Chatbot

### The Concept

A knowledge base chatbot trained on a lawyer's specific practice area that:
- **Saves lawyer time** by answering common client questions automatically
- **Gives clients 24/7 access** to information instead of waiting for callback
- **Reduces billable hour interruptions** for simple questions
- **Improves client satisfaction** with instant responses

### Validation Proof Point

**Friend's success:** Delivered a lawyer chatbot and netted a **$50,000 deal**

### Value Proposition

**For the lawyer:**
- Reduces time spent answering repetitive client questions (30-60 min/day saved)
- Fewer interruptions during billable work
- Clients get instant answers instead of waiting for callbacks
- Scales the practice without hiring more admin staff

**For the client:**
- 24/7 access to common legal questions
- Instant answers instead of waiting 24-48 hours
- Reduces anxiety during legal processes (divorce, estate planning, home buying, etc.)
- Clear expectations on process, timeline, next steps

### Potential Practice Areas (Keep Open for Mission 2)

**Option A: Estate Planning**
- Common questions: "Do I need a will or trust?", "What happens if I die without a will?", "How do I update my beneficiaries?"
- Documents: Will templates, trust explanations, power of attorney info

**Option B: Real Estate Law**
- Common questions: "What are closing costs?", "What's title insurance?", "How long does escrow take?"
- Documents: Contract explanations, timeline expectations, required disclosures

**Option C: Family Law (Divorce)**
- Common questions: "How is custody determined?", "What's community property?", "How long does divorce take?"
- Documents: Divorce process timeline, asset division rules, custody guidelines

**Option D: General Practice (Solo Practitioner)**
- Mix of practice areas
- Common intake questions across all areas
- Process explanations for each service type

### Client Avatar (Lawyer Chatbot Pattern)

**To be validated in Mission 2:**

**Solo Practitioner / Small Law Firm Owner**
- 1-5 attorneys
- $300K-$2M annual revenue
- 50-200 active clients
- Practice areas: Estate planning, real estate, family law, business formation
- Location: Any US city

**Pain Points:**
- Spends 30-60 min/day answering same questions repeatedly
- Clients call/email with basic questions during billable work
- New clients anxious, want immediate answers
- Can't scale without hiring admin staff to field questions
- Clients unhappy waiting 24-48 hours for simple answers

**Goals:**
- Reduce non-billable time answering repetitive questions
- Improve client satisfaction with instant responses
- Scale practice without hiring more staff
- Focus billable hours on actual legal work, not FAQs

**Budget:**
- Currently spending $2K-$5K/year on practice management software
- Willing to pay $200-$500/month for tool that saves 20+ hours/month
- ROI: If saves 30 hours/month at $300/hour billable rate = $9,000/month value

- [x] Friend's lawyer chatbot success story ($50K deal)

**Key insights discovered:**

**Pattern #1 (Form-Based):**
- Only opportunities saving $150K+/year are worth custom software
- High frequency × High time = The formula that works
- Most "mandatory forms" fail because frequency is too low
- Three validated examples: Fire inspection ($192K/year), OASIS ($243K-$729K/year), Prior Auth ($204K-$680K/year)
- Pattern repeats across inspection companies, home services, healthcare

**Pattern #2 (Lawyer Chatbot):**
- Lawyers spend 30-60 min/day answering repetitive client questions
- Clients want instant answers, not 24-48 hour wait times
- Friend validated this with $50K deal
- Multiple practice areas possible (estate, real estate, family law)
- ROI is clear: Save 20-30 hours/month at $300/hour billable rate = $6K-$9K/month value

## 4. Mission 2 Validation Strategy

**Goal:** Validate BOTH patterns in parallel through discovery calls

### Pattern #1: Form-Based Automation - Validation Plan

**Target Industries to Explore (Pick 2-3):**
1. Fire inspection companies (California AES forms)
2. Home health agencies (Medicare OASIS forms)
3. Physician practices (Prior authorizations)
4. HVAC service companies (service reports)
5. Pest control companies (treatment reports)

**Discovery Call Questions:**
1. "What forms are you legally required to fill out?"
2. "How long does that take you each time?"
3. "How many times per month do you fill it out?"
4. "What happens if you don't complete it correctly?"
5. "How do you currently complete it?" (Word doc, handwriting, software?)
6. "What software have you tried? Why did it fail?"

**Success Criteria:**
- Find 1 industry where: **(Frequency/month) × (Hours/form) × (Hourly rate) × 12 ≥ $150,000/year**
- Validate all 4 criteria are met (Manual Hell, High Frequency, Compliance-Critical, Terrible Software)
- Get 1-2 beta tester commitments
- Confirm pricing: $200-500/month range acceptable

### Pattern #2: Lawyer Chatbot - Validation Plan

**Target Lawyers to Talk To (2-3 minimum):**
- Solo practitioners or small firms (1-5 attorneys)
- Any practice area (estate planning, real estate, family law, business)
- $300K-$2M revenue range

**Discovery Call Questions:**
1. "How much time do you spend answering repetitive client questions?" (emails, calls)
2. "What are the top 10 questions clients always ask?"
3. "How long do clients typically wait for answers to simple questions?"
4. "Have you tried any client portal or FAQ solutions? Why didn't they work?"
5. "If clients could get instant answers 24/7, how would that change your practice?"
6. "What would you pay for a tool that saved you 20-30 hours/month?"

**Success Criteria:**
- Validate lawyers spend 30-60 min/day on repetitive client questions
- Identify 10-15 most common questions per practice area
- Confirm clients are frustrated by 24-48 hour wait times
- Get 1-2 beta tester commitments
- Confirm pricing: $200-500/month acceptable (given $6K-$9K/month value)

### Timeline

- [ ] Conduct 3-5 discovery calls for form-based pattern
- [ ] Conduct 2-3 discovery calls for lawyer chatbot pattern
- [ ] Document findings and value calculations
- [ ] Pick the stronger opportunity (or pursue both if both validate)

**Week 3-4:**
- [ ] Get beta tester commitments (2-3 minimum)
- [ ] Define MVP scope based on discovery calls
- [ ] Start building

## 5. Why These Two Patterns?

**Pattern #1 (Form-Based):**
- ✅ **Proven value:** Three examples saving $150K-$700K+/year
- ✅ **Clear pain:** Manual process hell, compliance-critical
- ✅ **Repeatable formula:** Easy to calculate ROI before discovery calls
- ✅ **Multiple industries:** If one doesn't work, pivot to another
- ⚠️ **Risk:** No unfair advantage, need to find right industry

**Pattern #2 (Lawyer Chatbot):**
- ✅ **Proven value:** Friend netted $50K deal
- ✅ **Clear pain:** Lawyers billing $300/hour shouldn't answer FAQs
- ✅ **Client value:** 24/7 access reduces anxiety
- ✅ **Scalable:** Can expand to other professional services (CPAs, consultants, etc.)
- ⚠️ **Risk:** No unfair advantage, need to validate time savings

**Why pursue both in parallel?**
- Diversifies risk (if one doesn't validate, have backup)
- Different value propositions (form automation vs. knowledge base)
- Both have clear ROI formulas
- Discovery calls can happen simultaneously (not sequential)

## 6. Questions for Basecamp Community

**Form-Based Pattern:**
1. Which industry should I prioritize first? (Fire inspection, home health, physician practices, HVAC, pest control?)
2. Any pioneers already exploring form automation? Lessons learned?
3. Best way to find businesses to interview? (LinkedIn, industry forums, cold outreach?)

**Lawyer Chatbot Pattern:**
4. How do I approach lawyers for discovery calls? (Cold outreach? Networking events? Referrals?)
5. Should I focus on one practice area (estate planning) or keep it general?
6. What's the biggest risk with chatbots? (Liability? Accuracy? Lawyers not trusting AI?)

**General:**
7. Is validating two patterns in parallel too ambitious for Mission 2? Should I pick one?
8. What's the best way to structure discovery calls to get honest answers about willingness to pay?
