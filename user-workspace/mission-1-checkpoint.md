# Mission 1 Checkpoint: Chris

**Date:** November 11, 2025
**Revenue Goal:** $10,000/month

---

## 1. Niche Selection

**Industry I chose:** Small Accounting & CPA Firms

**Why I chose this niche:**
- Have a good friend working in the accounting industry (unfair advantage for validation and testing)
- Large market ($145B industry, 88,000 firms in the US)
- Clear, painful problems that cost firms real money
- Strong profitability (20-40% margins) means they can afford software
- Labor shortage forcing firms to automate (urgency is NOW)
- Boring B2B business with manual processes everywhere

---

## 2. Research Summary

**Businesses researched:** 88,000 firms in market; deep research on small firms (2-20 employees)

**Research methods used:**
- [x] The Compass skills (niche-research, niche-opportunity-finder, problem-identifier, client-avatar-builder)
- [x] Industry forums (AccountantForums.com, TaxProTalk, Accounting Workflow Club)
- [x] Reddit (r/Accounting - 400K members, r/taxpros)
- [x] Software review sites (G2, Gartner reviews of Karbon, TaxDome, etc.)
- [x] Industry publications (Accounting Today, CPA Journal, Future Firm blog)
- [x] Market research reports (Financial Cents 2024/2025 Workflow Automation Report)
- [x] Competitive analysis (Karbon, TaxDome, Jetpack Workflow, ContentSnare, etc.)

**Key insights discovered:**
- **Document collection is the #1 pain point** (2024 research: surpassed even manual admin tasks)
- 55.5% of firms experience ongoing workflow inefficiencies
- Labor shortage crisis forcing automation (CPA exam takers dropped from 50K to 32K)
- Solo/small firms (under $1M revenue) are underserved—existing tools too expensive or complex
- Workflow is cited as biggest challenge by 63% of firms
- Most firms still use email + spreadsheets for critical workflows (huge opportunity)

## 3. Problems Identified

### Problem #1: Client Document Collection 🏆 **(PURSUING THIS ONE)**

**Description:**
Accounting firms waste 10-20 hours/month chasing clients for documents (W-2s, 1099s, receipts, bank statements) via email, phone calls, and manual follow-ups. Clients send docs via random channels (email, text, physical mail), firms track status in spreadsheets or memory, causing chaos especially during tax season.

**The 4 Criteria:**
- ✅ **Manual Process Hell:** Email follow-ups, phone calls, spreadsheet tracking, manual file organization. Pure chaos.
- ✅ **High-Frequency:** 100-300 document collection cycles per year per firm. Every client, every engagement.
- ✅ **Compliance/Revenue-Critical:** BOTH. Tax deadlines are legally mandated (compliance). Can't bill until docs arrive (revenue). Missed deadline = penalties + lost client.
- ✅ **Terrible Software:** Existing options are too expensive (Liscio $480-$960/year), too generic (ContentSnare), or firms just use email. Password fatigue prevents portal adoption.

**Value Calculation:**
- Time per client: 31 minutes (follow-ups, tracking, organizing)
- Frequency: 100 collection cycles/year (firm with 50 clients × 2 requests each)
- Hourly cost: $40/hour (staff accountant)
- **Annual time savings:** 51.7 hours × $40 = $2,068
- **Plus deadline prevention:** $500-$10,000/year (avoid one missed deadline)
- **Plus client retention:** $5,000-$50,000/year (retain clients who'd leave due to poor service)
- **Total annual value:** $15,000-$30,000

**Potential pricing:** $99-$199/month ($1,188-$2,388/year) = **12-20x ROI for client**

---

### Problem #2: Workflow Visibility & Engagement Tracking

**Description:**
Firms with 2+ employees can't see what's happening across the firm—which engagements are on track, which are at risk of missing deadlines, who has capacity. Managing partners waste 3-5 hours/week in status meetings asking "where are we on X?"

**The 4 Criteria:**
- ✅ **Manual Process Hell:** Asking around, status meetings, spreadsheets, whiteboards, memory. Coordination chaos.
- ✅ **High-Frequency:** Daily status checks, weekly meetings. 100-200 status checks per month.
- ⚠️ **Compliance/Revenue-Critical:** Revenue-critical (indirectly). Missed deadlines → lost clients → lost revenue.
- ✅ **Terrible Software:** Karbon too expensive ($10,680/year for 10 users), Jetpack too basic, TaxDome overcomplicated.

**Value Calculation:**
- Time saved: 4.5 hours/week × 50 weeks = 225 hours/year
- Hourly cost: $100/hour (managing partner)
- **Annual time savings:** 225 hours × $100 = $22,500
- **Plus better utilization:** 5-10% improvement = $10,000-$50,000 additional revenue
- **Total annual value:** $35,000-$90,000

**Potential pricing:** $149-$299/month ($1,788-$3,588/year)

**Note:** Strong problem (3.5/4 criteria) but Document Collection is stronger.

### Problem #3: Time Tracking & Billing Automation ⚠️

**Description:**
Firms billing hourly lose 10-20% of billable hours due to poor time tracking. Accountants forget to start timers, reconstruct time at end of week (inaccurate), leading to write-offs and delayed billing.

**The 4 Criteria:**
- ⚠️ **Manual Process Hell:** Semi-manual. Many firms already have tools (QuickBooks Time, Karbon), just don't use them well. Behavioral problem, not lack of software.
- ✅ **High-Frequency:** Multiple times daily (every staff member tracks time constantly).
- ✅ **Compliance/Revenue-Critical:** Strongly revenue-critical. Unbilled hours = direct revenue loss.
- ❌ **Terrible Software:** FAILS THIS CRITERION. Many options exist: QuickBooks Time ($8/month), Karbon, TimeSolv, Toggl, Harvest. Market is crowded.

**Value Calculation:**
- Revenue recapture: 15% write-off on $500K revenue = $75K lost. Recapture 50% = $37,500
- Time savings: 15 hours/month × $50/hour = $9,000/year
- **Total annual value:** $30,000-$45,000

**Potential pricing:** $79-$149/month

**Note:** NOT PURSUING. Scores 2.5/4 (fails criterion #4). Too much competition. QuickBooks, Karbon, Toggl, Harvest all established players.

## 4. Client Avatar

**Company profile:**
- **Industry:** Accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping firms
- **Size:** 2-10 employees, $300K-$1M annual revenue
- **Client volume:** 30-100 active clients
- **Location:** Any US city (starting local for validation)
- **Service model:** Tax prep (individual + business), monthly bookkeeping, quarterly advisory

**Decision maker:**
- **Title:** Firm Owner / Managing Partner / CPA
- **Pain points:**
  - Waste 10-20 hours/month chasing clients for documents
  - Miss deadlines or file extensions due to late client docs
  - Can't scale without hiring more admin staff
  - Work 70-hour weeks during tax season (Jan-Apr)
- **Goals:**
  - Grow to 150-200 clients without hiring admin
  - Work 40-50 hour weeks during tax season (not 70)
  - Spend more time on advisory, less on busywork
- **Budget range:** $1,000-$3,000/year for software (already spending $2K-$8K on QuickBooks, tax software, etc.)

**Buying triggers:**
- Just finished brutal tax season → "Never again"
- Preparing for next tax season (Nov-Dec) → "Need to fix this before January"
- Lost a client due to missed deadline → "Can't let this happen again"

## 5. Next Steps

**Which problem am I pursuing first?**
**Problem #1: Client Document Collection**

**Why this one?**
- Perfect score: 4/4 criteria met
- Identified as #1 pain point in 2024 industry research (not just my opinion)
- Universal problem (every firm, every size, every geography)
- Clear, measurable ROI ($15K-$30K value for $1.2K-$2.4K cost)
- My friend can validate and be first beta user (unfair advantage)
- Lower competition than workflow visibility or time tracking
- Medium build complexity (doable with Claude Code)

**What I need help with:**
- Validating my value calculation with real firms (is $15K-$30K accurate?)
- Pricing strategy: Should I start at $99/month or $149/month?
- MVP feature prioritization: Email only first, or email + SMS from day 1?

---

## 6. Challenges & Questions

**What I'm struggling with:**
- Haven't talked to my friend yet to validate this (need to schedule that call this week)
- Unsure if I should build email-only MVP first or go straight to email + SMS
- Wondering if $99/month is too low (leaving money on table) or just right for solo firms

**Questions for Zane / community:**
1. **Pricing:** For a solution saving $15K-$30K/year, is $99/month too cheap? Should I start higher ($149) and discount down, or start lower and raise prices later?
2. **MVP scope:** Would you launch with just email automation first, or is SMS critical from day 1? (SMS adds complexity via Twilio integration)
3. **Validation:** Besides my friend, how many discovery calls should I do before building? Is 3-5 enough, or should I talk to 10+?
4. **Competition:** ContentSnare exists at $89-$179/month. How do I differentiate beyond "built for accountants"? Is that enough?

## 7. Commitment

**Mission 2 starts next week. I commit to:**
- [x] Validating my top problem with my friend this week (show them the research, get feedback)
- [x] Doing 2-3 additional discovery calls with CPA firms (ask friend for intros)
- [x] Staying active in Basecamp (posting updates, engaging with others)
- [x] Joining Wednesday's live call (bring my pricing question to Zane)
