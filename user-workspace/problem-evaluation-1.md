## Evaluation Against 4 Criteria

### ✅ Criterion 1: Manual Process Hell

**Status:** YES - This is absolutely manual process hell

**Details:** Current process for most firms:
1. Send email to client: "Please send me your tax documents"
2. Wait 3-7 days
3. Send follow-up email #1: "Just checking in, did you get my email about documents?"
4. Wait another 3-5 days
5. Send follow-up email #2: "We need these documents to complete your return"
6. Sometimes call the client
7. Track which docs are received in spreadsheet or memory
8. Client sends docs via email, text, physical mail, or fax (all different channels)
9. Manually organize documents into client folders
10. Repeat for every client, every engagement

**Current tools used:**
- Email (Gmail, Outlook)
- Excel spreadsheets to track document status
- Manual file organization
- Memory ("Did Johnson send his W-2 yet?")

**Assessment:**
This is textbook manual process hell. No automation, no centralized tracking, scattered across multiple channels. Firms are using the most primitive tools possible (email and spreadsheets) to manage a critical business process.

**Evidence from research:**
- "Chasing clients for additional documents was the second most challenging part of leading an accounting team" (2023 survey of 132 firm owners)
- Identified as #1 workflow issue in 2024, surpassing even manual admin tasks
- Firms describe this as "nightmare," "drowning," "losing track"

---

### ✅ Criterion 2: High-Frequency Repetition

**Status:** YES - Extremely high frequency

**Frequency:**
- **Per client:** 1-4 times per year (depending on service: tax return, quarterly bookkeeping, annual audit)
- **Per firm:** If firm has 50 clients, and each needs documents 2x/year = 100 document collection cycles/year
- **Monthly:** Firm with 50 clients = 8-10 active document collection processes every month
- **Per engagement:** 3-5 follow-ups per client = 24-50 follow-up actions per month

**Detailed frequency breakdown:**
- Tax firms: Every client, once per year (Jan-Apr peak)
- Bookkeeping firms: Every monthly client, 12 times per year
- Audit firms: Every client annually, plus interim requests
- Advisory firms: Ad-hoc but frequent

**Assessment:**
This easily exceeds the 10+ times per month threshold. Even a solo CPA with 30 clients has 30+ document collection cycles per year, which is 2-3 per month minimum. Larger firms (50-100 clients) deal with this constantly—multiple clients every single week.

**Evidence from research:**
- "Every single client, every single engagement (monthly, quarterly, annual)"
- Tax season alone creates 100+ document requests for a mid-size firm
- Year-round problem for firms doing monthly bookkeeping

---

### ✅ Criterion 3: Compliance or Revenue-Critical

**Status:** YES - BOTH compliance AND revenue critical

**Type:** Both Compliance and Revenue-Critical

**Compliance aspect:**
- **Tax deadlines are non-negotiable:** April 15, October 15 (extensions), quarterly estimated payments
- **Can't file without documents:** W-2s, 1099s, receipts are legally required for tax filings
- **Late filing = penalties:** IRS penalties for late filing, client blames the firm
- **Firm liability:** If firm files incorrectly due to missing docs, firm can be liable

**Revenue aspect:**
- **Can't bill until work is complete:** Most firms don't invoice until return is finished
- **Delayed documents = delayed cash flow:** Waiting for client docs delays billing by weeks or months
- **Lost billable time:** Time spent chasing docs is often unbilled (write-offs)
- **Client retention:** Missed deadlines or poor experience = client switches firms

**Assessment:**
This is a rare double-hit: BOTH compliance-critical AND revenue-critical.

Tax deadlines are legally mandated—there's no wiggle room. Missing a deadline can cost the client $500-$2,000 in penalties, and the client will blame the firm even if it was the client's fault for not sending documents.

On the revenue side, firms can't complete work and bill clients until documents arrive. This creates cash flow problems. Additionally, 10-20 hours/month of staff time chasing documents is either unbilled (lost revenue) or billed and creates client friction ("Why am I paying you to remind me?").

**Evidence from research:**
- "Tax deadlines non-negotiable (April 15, Oct 15, etc.)"
- "Missing client docs = can't complete work = file extension = unhappy client"
- "Late filings = penalties for client = firm's fault in client's eyes"
- "Can't bill until work is complete"

---

### ✅ Criterion 4: Terrible Existing Software

**Status:** YES - Existing solutions are inadequate

**Current options and why they fail:**

1. **ContentSnare** ($89-$179/month)
   - **Problem:** Generic content collection tool, not built for accountants
   - **Problem:** No SMS reminders (email only)
   - **Problem:** Still requires client to log into portal (password fatigue)
   - **Gap:** Not accounting-specific (no tax document templates)

2. **Liscio** ($40-$80/user/month)
   - **Problem:** Expensive for solo firms ($480-$960/year for one person)
   - **Problem:** Built for mid-size firms, overkill for solo/small firms
   - **Gap:** Pricing doesn't work for solo CPAs making $62K/year

3. **SmartVault** (document storage)
   - **Problem:** Focuses on storage, not collection
   - **Problem:** Weak on reminders and client-facing checklists
   - **Gap:** No automated follow-up system

4. **Practice management tools** (Karbon, TaxDome, etc.)
   - **Problem:** Document collection is a minor feature, not the focus
   - **Problem:** Expensive overall ($89-$300/user/month)
   - **Problem:** Complex to set up and learn
   - **Gap:** Solo firms can't afford $1,068+/year for one feature

5. **What most firms actually use:** Email + spreadsheets
   - **Problem:** Completely manual
   - **Problem:** No automation
   - **Problem:** No tracking
   - **Problem:** Documents scattered across email, text, physical mail

**Assessment:**
The market is underserved. Existing tools are either:
- Too expensive for solo/small firms
- Too generic (not accounting-specific)
- Too complex (full practice management when they just need doc collection)
- Missing key features (SMS, no-password upload, accounting-specific templates)

The fact that most firms still use email + spreadsheets proves the existing software doesn't solve the problem well enough.

**Gap in market:**
An affordable ($99-$199/month), accounting-specific, client-friendly document collection system with:
- SMS + email reminders
- No password required (email/text upload links)
- Tax-specific templates (W-2, 1099, Schedule C, receipts)
- Progress dashboard for the firm
- Under $200/month price point

This gap is wide open.

**Evidence from research:**
- "Current portals have password fatigue issues"
- "Too complex for clients to navigate"
- "No smart automation (reminders, deadline tracking, completion status)"
- "Missing: Text/email integration for non-tech-savvy clients"

## Value Calculation

### Time Saved Per Client Per Engagement:

**Current manual process:**
- Initial email request: 5 minutes
- Follow-up email #1: 5 minutes
- Follow-up email #2: 5 minutes
- Phone call (if needed): 10 minutes
- Tracking in spreadsheet: 3 minutes
- Organizing received documents: 5 minutes
- **Total time per client:** 33 minutes (0.55 hours)

**With automation:**
- Set up automated request: 2 minutes
- System sends reminders automatically: 0 minutes
- Client uploads directly: 0 minutes (client's time, not firm's)
- Organizing happens automatically: 0 minutes
- **Total time per client:** 2 minutes (0.03 hours)

**Time saved per client:** 31 minutes (0.52 hours)

---

### Calculation for Mid-Size Firm (50 clients, 2x/year document requests):

**Annual frequency:** 50 clients × 2 requests/year = 100 document collection cycles

**Time saved:**
- Per collection: 31 minutes
- Annual: 100 × 31 minutes = 3,100 minutes = **51.7 hours/year**

**Hourly cost:**
- Staff accountant doing this work: $30-50/hour (loaded cost)
- Conservative estimate: $40/hour

**Annual value:**
- 51.7 hours × $40/hour = **$2,068/year**

---

### Calculation for Larger Firm (100 clients, 3x/year):

**Annual frequency:** 100 clients × 3 requests/year = 300 document collection cycles

**Time saved:**
- Per collection: 31 minutes
- Annual: 300 × 31 minutes = 9,300 minutes = **155 hours/year**

**Hourly cost:** $40/hour (staff accountant)

**Annual value:**
- 155 hours × $40/hour = **$6,200/year**

---

### Additional Value Beyond Time Savings:

1. **Prevent missed deadlines:**
   - One missed tax deadline = $500-$2,000 penalty for client
   - Client may leave firm = $2,000-$10,000 lifetime value lost
   - Even preventing ONE missed deadline pays for software

2. **Improved cash flow:**
   - Documents arrive faster = work completed faster = billing happens sooner
   - Get paid 1-2 weeks earlier = cash flow improvement
   - For firm billing $50K/month, 2-week acceleration = $25K cash flow boost

3. **Better client experience:**
   - Clients get clear checklist instead of vague "send me your docs" email
   - No more "did I already send that?" confusion
   - Professional impression = retention + referrals

4. **Staff sanity:**
   - Eliminate frustrating, repetitive task
   - Reduce stress during tax season
   - Improve employee retention

**Total annual value (comprehensive):**
- Time savings: $2,000-$6,000/year
- Deadline prevention: $500-$10,000/year (if prevents one issue)
- Cash flow improvement: Unmeasured but significant
- Client retention: $5,000-$50,000/year (if retains one client who would have left)

**Conservative total: $7,500-$20,000/year**
**Realistic total: $15,000-$30,000/year**

## Suggested Pricing

**Monthly SaaS:**
- **$99/month** for solo firms (1 user, unlimited clients)
- **$149/month** for small teams (2-5 users)
- **$199/month** for mid-size firms (6-10 users)

**Annual pricing:**
- $1,188/year (solo)
- $1,788/year (small team)
- $2,388/year (mid-size)

**ROI for client (solo firm example):**
- Annual cost: $1,188
- Annual value: $15,000 (conservative estimate)
- **ROI: 12.6x** (they get $15K value for $1.2K cost)
- Pays for itself in less than 1 month of tax season

**Pricing justification:**
- Saves 2-5 hours/week during tax season
- At $200/hour billing rate (what they COULD bill instead) = $400-$1,000/week value
- $99/month is pocket change compared to value delivered

**Alternative: One-time + monthly:**
- $2,000-$5,000 upfront implementation
- $49-$99/month ongoing

- **Quantify:** "If I could automate 90% of this, what would that be worth to you?"
- **Pricing:** "Would you pay $99/month for a system that does this automatically?"

### 2. Build Quick Prototype (Week 2-3):
- **MVP features:**
  - Send document request email with checklist
  - Client clicks link to upload (no login required)
  - You see progress dashboard (what's received, what's missing)
  - Automated reminders every 3 days
- **Test with your friend:** Use it for 5-10 real clients
- **Measure:** Did it actually save them time? By how much?

### 3. Get 2-3 More Discovery Calls (Week 3-4):
- **Ask your friend:** "Who else in your network struggles with this?"
- **Get intros:** Call 2-3 other CPA firm owners
- **Validate:** Is this pain universal? Will they pay?

### 4. Post in Basecamp for Feedback:
- Share this evaluation
- Ask Zane: "Does this problem pass the smell test?"
- Get input from other pioneers
- **Community validation before you build**

### 5. If Validation Succeeds:
- Build full MVP (4-6 weeks)
- Offer beta to friend + 2-3 other firms
- Charge discounted rate ($49/month for beta users)
- Iterate based on feedback
- Launch publicly

## Red Flags to Watch For

During validation, watch for these warning signs:

❌ **"We've been living with it"** - If they're not actively frustrated, not painful enough
❌ **"Our current portal works fine"** - If existing solution is "good enough," hard to displace
❌ **"We wouldn't pay for that"** - If they won't commit to paying, don't build it
❌ **"Only a problem during tax season"** - If it's truly seasonal (Jan-Apr only), harder to justify year-round subscription
❌ **"Boss won't approve new software"** - If decision maker is inaccessible, dead end

**If you hear 2+ of these during discovery calls, reconsider.**

But based on the research, this is unlikely. The pain is well-documented and acute.
