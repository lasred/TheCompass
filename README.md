## What is The Compass?

The Compass is an AI agent powered by Claude Code that guides you through building a profitable AI software business.

It's not just documentation - it's an active partner that:
- Guides you step-by-step through missions
- Uses specialized skills to accelerate your work
- Creates output files tracking your progress
- Keeps you connected to the Basecamp community
- Remembers your goals and personalizes everything

## How It Works

### Your Personal Workspace

All your work is saved in `/user-workspace/` directory:
- Research files from your niche analysis
- Problem evaluations against the 4 criteria
- Your client avatar
- Mission checkpoints for sharing

**This folder is private** (gitignored) - your work doesn't get pushed to GitHub.

### The Mission System

**Mission 1: Problem & Niche Selection** (Week 1 - Available Now)
- Pick your niche
- Identify problems worth $20K+
- Create client avatar
- Complete checkpoint

**Mission 2-6:** Unlock weekly
- Run `git pull` each week to get new content
- Each mission builds on the previous

### Weekly Updates

Every Monday, new missions unlock:
1. Zane announces in Basecamp
2. You run `git pull` in your terminal
3. New content appears in The Compass
4. Continue your journey
