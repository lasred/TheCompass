# What is The Compass?

The Compass is your AI business-building super agent, powered by Claude Code.

## Not Just a Repository

Most GitHub repos are static documentation.

The Compass is different.

It's an active AI agent that:
- Guides you through missions step by step
- Uses specialized skills to accelerate your research
- Personalizes everything to your name, goals, and "why"
- Reminds you to engage with the Basecamp community
- Keeps you accountable and moving forward

## How It Works

When you open The Compass in VS Code with Claude Code:

1. **First time:** It asks your name, revenue goal, and "why" - creating your personalized config
2. **Every session:** It greets you personally and checks where you are in your current mission
3. **During work:** It guides you step-by-step, using skills to accelerate research and create output files
4. **Progress tracking:** It checks which files you've created to know your progress
5. **When stuck:** It encourages you to "go back to camp" and get help from the community
6. **When you win:** It pushes you to share in Basecamp

### Your Workspace

All your work lives in `/user-workspace/`:
- **my-niche-research.md** - Your industry research and opportunities
- **problem-evaluation-[N].md** - Your evaluated problems
- **my-client-avatar.md** - Your ideal customer profile
- **mission-1-checkpoint.md** - Your weekly deliverable

The Compass creates these files as you work. They're private (gitignored) so they won't be pushed to GitHub.

### The Skill Chain

The Compass uses specialized skills in sequence:

**Mission 1 sequence:**
1. **niche-research** → Creates your research file
2. **niche-opportunity-finder** → Adds opportunities
3. **problem-identifier** → Evaluates problems (use multiple times)
4. **client-avatar-builder** → Defines your customer

Each step builds on the previous. The Compass won't let you skip ahead.

### Progress Tracking

The Compass knows where you are by checking which files exist:
- ✅ Niche research file exists? Step 1 complete.
- ✅ Problem evaluation files exist? Step 3 complete.
- ✅ Client avatar exists? Step 4 complete.
- ✅ Checkpoint exists? Mission 1 complete!

When you return, it picks up exactly where you left off.

## The Personalization

The Compass remembers:
- Your name
- Your revenue goal
- Your "why" for building this business
- Which mission you're on
- When you last worked

It uses this to:
- Greet you personally
- Remind you of your goals when you're stuck
- Keep you motivated
- Track your progress

## Community Integration

The Compass constantly encourages you to:
- Share wins in Basecamp
- Post challenges when stuck
- Engage with other pioneers
- Join live calls

It's not trying to replace community. It's pushing you INTO community.

## Weekly Updates

Every week, Zane adds new content:
- New missions unlock
- New skills are added
- New templates and frameworks
- Real examples from his client work

Run `git pull` to get the latest updates.

## Your Role

The Compass is a tool. You're the builder.

It accelerates your work. It doesn't do the work for you.

You still need to:
- Make decisions
- Do research
- Talk to businesses (starting Mission 3)
- Build software (Mission 5)
- Close clients (Mission 6)

The Compass makes you faster. Not passive.

## Getting Started

Open CLAUDE.md and say "hello."

The Compass will configure itself and guide you into Mission 1.
