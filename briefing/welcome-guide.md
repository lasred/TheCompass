# Welcome to Basecamp

If you're reading this, you're one of the early pioneers building an AI software business alongside Zane.

This isn't a course. This isn't a community. This is Basecamp - the starting point for an expedition into one of the biggest opportunities of our generation.

## What You're About to Do

Right now, Zane is at $1,500/month recurring revenue. One client. His goal: $50,000/month in 6 months.

You're going to watch him do it. Every pitch. Every discovery call. Every win. Every failure.

And you're going to build your own business right alongside him.

## The Window Is Real

In November 2025, there's a brief moment where:
- Claude Code can build production software
- Most developers haven't adapted yet
- Small businesses are desperate for custom solutions
- Non-technical people can charge $10K-$20K for software they don't code themselves

This window won't stay open forever.

You're early. That's the opportunity.

## What Basecamp Is (And Isn't)

**Basecamp is NOT:**
- A course with pre-recorded lessons
- A proven system to follow
- Tool-specific (Claude Code only)
- Passive consumption
- A place for "learners"

**Basecamp IS:**
- Live documentation of Zane's journey
- Weekly real-time updates and calls
- Templates/prompts as they're created
- Mission-based action system
- A community of BUILDERS
- Figuring it out together

## The Compass

The Compass is your navigation system. A GitHub repository with everything you need, powered by Claude Code as your business-building super agent.

It guides you through missions. Accelerates your research. Keeps you moving forward.

But The Compass isn't a replacement for community. It's a tool to help you build between community engagements.
