# How Basecamp Works

Basecamp runs on a weekly cadence:

## The Weekly Rhythm

**MONDAYS - TRANSMISSIONS**
Every Monday, Zane drops a "transmission" - what he learned that week.

New discovery call script he tested? You get it.
Pitch that landed a client? He breaks it down.
Template he created? Added to The Compass immediately.

Real-time documentation. Not polished lessons.

**WEDNESDAYS - LIVE CALLS**
Every Wednesday at 2pm PT, we gather.

Zane gives updates on his business. Hot seats. Q&A. Problem solving.

Can't make it? Recording posted immediately.

**ONGOING - THE COMMUNITY**
Between Mondays and Wednesdays, the community is active.

Ask questions. Share wins. Get feedback. Build relationships.

This is where the real building happens.

## The Missions

You'll work through 6 missions over 6 weeks:

- **Mission 1:** Find your niche and identify problems
- **Mission 2:** Validate those problems
- **Mission 3:** Start outreach and discovery calls
- **Mission 4:** Create proposals and scope projects
- **Mission 5:** Build prototypes with Claude Code
- **Mission 6:** Close clients and deliver

Each mission unlocks when you're ready. No overwhelm.

## The Compass

Your GitHub repo with frameworks, templates, and skills.

It updates every week as Zane creates new systems.

Everything he uses in his business, you get access to immediately.

## The Culture

**Builders ship rough** - 80% is good enough. Ship and iterate.

**We fly together** - Your win is everyone's win. Help each other.

**Pioneer mindset** - We're early. Embrace uncertainty.

**Build in public** - Share your progress, wins, and failures.

## What This Isn't

This isn't passive learning.

You're not here to consume content. You're here to build.

If you're waiting for perfect information before starting, you're in the wrong place.

Pioneers move first, figure it out later.

That's the culture. That's how we build.
